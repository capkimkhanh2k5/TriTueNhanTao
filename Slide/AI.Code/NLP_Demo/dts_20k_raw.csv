Very very clean big rooms & comfy beds. The property seemed full but very quiet. Excellent friendly & helpful staff. Very nice indoor pool. Restaurant very hand and good. Bar very nice also. Will definitely stay again!!!!,1
 Our room seemed to have some electrical problems likely due to all of the fun decorations features that they added to the room For example the multitude of light switches for the bathroom seemed to have a different function each time they were used sometimes the lights would not even come on the jets for the bath tub did not work and the switch to raise and lower the television from the footboard of the bed did not work properly it would raise but not lower However this is not that different than one would expect from driving a French made car  The staff was very friendly responsive and provided a helpful concierge service The hotel was well decorated we enjoyed the champagne theme and very clean The location was excellent with close proximity to metro transit restaurants and tourist sites ,1
"Recently stayed for - nights and it was heavenly!!! Great Lobby, great front desk staff; upgraded our room from -th to --th and it gave us access to a balcony-terrace! The room was huge with a sitting room and a large size bedroom with a fabulous bathroom. My husband and I are very picky travellers and we pay attention to the details. Two complimentary drinks tickets, and Champagne delivered for our Anniversary, with a special letter! Very fine touches, of fresh flowers, water and chocolates for an evening turn down. Really nice decor and quality of room furniture. WE LOVED the bed, and the bathroom the most!
We would definitely stay here again! Great location, great bellman, and even gave guests access to - computers in a private area off the lobby! Extremely attentive to the guests needs! Love it!!!",1
 check in out could be faster simple perfect location,1
 no complaints Staff were friendly and helpful Excellent location Recommended car park was well worth the extra money ,1
 breakfast a bit overpriced spacy room friendly staff price,1
 The room was mostly clean but there was some mold in the grouting in the shower and one of the bed side tables had been moved forward and there was lots of dust behind it  It was right next to Shepherd s bush tube station I was going to a gig at Bush Hall and I was able to walk there The room was well decorated of a good size and the bed was comfy ,1
 Bathroom not quite as clean as expected Danger zone where I fell on split floor tile in bathroom Bathroom floor hadn t been cleaned or hadn t been cleaned properly Fell and hurt myself when My Footcaught on split tile on floor Lucky I didn t have worst fall than what I did Fell and hurt myself there  Didn t have breakfast included in stay Was unaware of this prior ,0
 Staff were rude particularly the man at the desk Internet was expensive at 6 24hr and after being told that it was exceptionally good we found that it was amongst the worst internet in 5 weeks of travelling the location of the hotel is not good when walking back at night not a pleasant area of town We won t recommend or return or use at of their other hotels in any other city  Not much,0
 The shower was horrible almost no water coming out The pool supposed to be heated but it was very very cold  friendly staff good breakfast parking outside free ,0

 Very poor breakfast If you book through booking with cancel policy when paying at the desk they take money twice first pre autorisation than final payment Be careful  Location location location,1
 The spa really dis organised and low quality service and certainly not value for money  The view is good but extra expensive to have a room with a view Your basically sold a room that shows an image of a good view Then when you check in you clearly don t have a view and are offered 80 100 on top per night for a room with a view,0
No Negative Good and comfortable accommodation The food is tasty and varied The hotel has wifi in the whole building it s free ,1
 I was disappointed that the hotel didn t make any mention of my wife s birthday after I have specifically emailed them to ask if they could make her 30th birthday trip more special by recognising the significance of the trip to London No Positive,1
 Reception check in was very busy and understaffed and a trainee was left to check me in on her own but she was a little slow and made a few small errors  Lovely Art Deco style hotel Great central location Also great for Heathrow express as it s three minute walk away Bedrooms are really nice and the bed was fantastically comfortable Didn t have food so can t comment As is often the case mini bar prices are extortionate,1
"I've arrived in NY i late evening. In hostel reception I heard that of course I have valid confirmed reservation, but they don't have free rooms ?!? I haven't got such serious situation in much more wild countries. But this is NY - the middle of civilisation ?!
Man in reception told me, that there is nobody responsible for that situation, and today it is impossible to solve the problem, so I should take myself and find any hotel as soon as I can (it wasn't easy). I returned to West Side Inn next day, they gave me back money for more expensive room in other hotel and gave me also little discount for next nights in West Side Inn. No simple word like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sorry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Next days I saw many times people on reception desk with the same problem. So I think - avoid this hostel.",0
 Undergoing renovations currently so was noisy during the day  Spacious room friendly helpful staff delicious breakfast and welcome drink in the bar courtyard very pleasant Best of all were the helpful instructions to find the hotel We travelled by train from Malpensa which took about an hour and was seamless we don t speak any Italian Supermarket opposite hotel Great area for restaurants and about a half hour walk to Duomo ,1

 Nothing  Beautiful hotel in an excellent location and the staff we very helpful and friendly ,1
 The room very small booked deluxe room but it was like what I would expect of a standard room Usually get extras such as dressing gown and slippers Very poor value for money as this was booked for a special occasion very disappointed The location,0
No Negative This hotel was in a very good position and I enjoyed my short stay ,1
 Can t complain about anything Everything Most of all it was super friendly,1
 Standard Double or Twin Room is like a low budget hotel room small and smelly room clogged bath tub outdated furniture dirty carpet The photos provided on the website don t correspond to the actual state of the room  The location is the only thing which was good about this hotel Inner yard oriented room so it was quiet ,0
 The reception staff had different solutions for one problem Only few of them speak english Expensive parking 15 night for hotel clients No international tv channels and wi fi does not connect but it s free for two hours during your stay no matter the nights The rooms do not include maps for tourists or any other information guide about the city  We liked the cleaning service They were very responsive and prompt The room is spacious the bed is big and confy A very nice view to the front fountains ,1
 our room was not ready waited for 3 hours and when it was ready the room smelled like someone was smoking it in it smelled disgusting wifi sucks it keeps kicking us off tub and sink clogged staff not accommodating attitude so so  location though there are a lot more hotels near by which we should have gone for ,0
 Noise Everything was great,1
 shower in the bathroom noy workingNo Positive,0
No Negative We liked that the hotel was situated outwith central Amsterdam yet easily accessible by tram it is closer to the Vondel Park and museum areas which are particularly attractive parts of the city The hotel is modern with top class facilities ,1
 Staff were not helpful specially on the concierge side the place needs complete renovation I stayed in this hotel many times in the past and hotel standard was good but I don t think will do it again  Location,0
 Room and bathroom very tired looking need a complete makeover No Positive,0
 Over priced Not what I d expect from a suite that cost 430 for one night Room was noisy could here music pumping into the early hours Flashing fire light kept flashing all night in bedroom Taps in bathroom were not fitted correctly Not be staying there again No Positive,0
"Rooms very nicely finished, little on the small side but very comfortable. Reception is fab. Wifi free if in the reception area, charged for the rooms. Great local bar across the way, can't remember the name but full of boxing pictures.",1
 We went to the bar in the evening The staff told us we had to spend 25 per person to go to the terrace and also would not let us sit in the large booths that we wanted to That was after we spent 800 in the restaurant The champagne brunch was amazing We stayed over too and the facilities in the room were exceptional,1
 Hated the fact that there was a lot of construction noise from 8 20am on both Friday and Saturday I appreciate that this would happen in the week but was very disappointed and annoyed to be awoken on the weekend Due to this I thought the room was extremely overpriced  The bedroom facilities and hotel in general ,0
 Booked a twin room in error asked to upgrade the young man was not very helpful My brother arrived the evening before me and was upgraded to a double without ant fuss or cost I feel that the male member of staff was out if his depth Reported to only been there two weeks and it was quote apparent Breakfast very good,0
"The hotel is a good business hotel for a night or two, but I was amazed at the quality of the food in the restaurant. Vivace's items came out done perfectly. The calamari was fresh, crunchy and delicious. The cannoli were amazing!
Very good chef.",1
 The food was quite expensive so we did not eat here until our last night But in saying that the food was amazing  The bed was unbelievably comfy The view we had was amazing the staff were friendly and the tram 13 into the city was right outside the hotel ,1
 Most of the rooms are too far away from the elevators Long corridors fed up with walking  Everything except the long corridors are good ,0
 We had difficulties with house keeping They didnt restock the minibar daily which as we found out later meant we were charged for additional drinks we didn t consume Unfortunately the staff cleaning the room didn t speak English and as per the supervisors explanation this was a problem across the floor  The room was very spacious and the hotel ideally located In room dining highly recommended The food was quality and well priced great for a easy meal after a day of sight seeing The bar was great and family friendly ,1
"THIS WAS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. I can't even say that it is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, because we ended up leaving and staying somewhere else! When we arrived, there was a sign outside the front desk saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""manager will return momentarily"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". After -- minutes of waiting, literally, a man finally arrives and starts yelling at us for being impatient! We ask what has taken so long and why we had to wait -- minutes to be helped and he starts cursing at us and telling us we had to leave. When we asked for our money back, he called the cops on us!!!! I have never in my life been treated in such an unprofessional and horrific way. Whatever you do, do NOT stay at this hotel.",0
 Hotel could do with a facelift throughout Attentive service very efficient concierge,1
 Can t fault this stay  Lovely room in the perfect location for me as I needed to be at the gym across the street the next morning Then grab a bus on the same rd to my work Clean and comfortable with good wifi to get some work done and super friendly check in and room service staff ,1
 Room was cold despite a small electric radiator that had been added Fan in bathroom sounded like a diesel generator and you couldn t switch it off Tried heating airconditioning but that was also very noisey like a jet engine so switched off Water was cold for bath and shower Staff were friendly and helpful Location is great for Mayfair Hyde Park and a reasonable price ,0
 Nothing Great location great facilities and very clean staff very helpful,1
No Negative Excellent value for money Room service dinner excellent ,1
 Transparent wall between bathroom and bedroom Bathroom didn t have a door No Positive,1
 None  The location Walking distance to everything Near bus stop underground waterloo brigde overlooking the london attractio and covent garden is walking distance only Facilities is standard Big bed ,1
 Nothing Staff attentive and friendly without being obsequious,1
 Room 102 is very small and pokey room Don t book this one Disappointed that we were given this when others were available  Very clean and modern ,0
 Restaurant did not open for our stay although hotel was busy Food choices consisted of 5 choices of food in the bar which i must confess were more like readymeals but cost around 17euros each If you have a very small selection at least do them well Had a rather expensive superior room which was tiny and tbh naff Nothing would posess me to call this room superior and im still cross about the price we had to pay for it As the queen size bed was two singles pushed together with two single quilts  Pleasant staff stylish reception lounge and bar ,0
 Dinner in room on night of my arrival was not nice Ordered breakfast in my room for following morning It never arrived Wifi was not usable No bottled water in rooms Bed soft but comfortable,0
 hauskeepink not knocking wenn cam ing into room  Yes,1
 Half of the hotel is under construction so some rooms are new some is old And unfortunately our room is the old one In the midnight bathroom door lock suddenly got broken and didn t open it was around 2a m we called the guest service then 2 guys came and try to open the door during 30minutes like a nightmare But rest of the stay was good breakfast was very good stuff are helpfull and rooms are very clean No Positive,0
 There was not any product in the bathroom the price is in my opinion a bit high for the room and there was no fitting room or SPA  The breakfast was really great People at the reception were nice and had warmly welcomed us ,0
 fridge or mini bar not working reported many times kettle not working very expensive priced breakfast can get across the road for half the price poor room service very expensive room rate for this room we could have stayed in a better place at cheaper price the downstairs lobby toilet was filthy with toilet paper all over the floor as per photos  THE BED WAS OK,0
 Price of the breakfast and selection not good Junior suite room was spacious clean and comfortable location was ideal,1
 I didn t get the room I booked The hotel and staff were lovely,0
 Can t think of anything  Fantastic in all respects breakfast too even early in the morning Staff helpful Would book again Room fine all we needed Excellent value for money Highly recommended ,1
 The staff was extremely rude always late sometimes they never showed up Water was cold and they even brought me dirty utinsles I will never ever ever stay in his hotel again  The location is amazing ,0
"If you want the true Gritty Urban Realism experience in New York, then this is the place for you. All the thrills of a tenement house--no heat, no water, paper-thin walls, greasy overcooked food smells coming from the community kitchens, doors with questionable locks, a creaky ancient elevator with barely room for two, and non-responsive management that is sullen at best, belligerant and bullying at worst. Want cable tv? Go to the basement. Want a washcloth? Bring your own. Make sure your credit card isn't charged until you check out. Hotel it is not. I wouldn't even kennel my dog here. Do yourself a tremendous favor and book a room at the Days Inn down the road (about - blocks). This dump doesn't even rate one circle on the experience scale. I can't say this strongly enough: DON'T STAY HERE.",0
 the room was very bed smelling the walls and carpet was dirty the bed was very uncomfortable for that price it is not worth we had to pay for baby coat 10euros what normally is for free when you pay so much I would not recommend that hotel at all  localisation,0
No Negative Good value for London Within walking distance of many activities and very clean Professional staff were very helpful ,1
 Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london L emplacement le quartier,0
 no parking reserved even when specially requested no baby crib ready even when specially requested had to pay for retrieving the phone that fell in hotel s lift shaft part of hotel high chair unavailable for baby in the restaurant location comfortable bed clean,0
 Room was rather dated and basic for the cost  Location friendly staff,0
 I thought that the room was bigger I liked the staff they were really friendly and I also liked the atmosphere it was very cosy and the bed was very comfortable I will definitely come again ,1
 The room service at night was terrible staff couldn t even provide a glass of water with ice She told me to go and find the ice dispenser near the lifts  The reception staff and breakfast staff were really helpful And it was in great location of the se arena ,0
 Breakfast price too expensive  Bed really comfortable lots of space in the room,1
No Negative Helpful friendly staff,1
No Negative Ok for one night stay near central station,0
 Room a bit smallNo Positive,1
 No power in morning and no power in Bathroom Price and location and quiet room,1
 Breakfast selection was not very good sweaty plastic cheese is disgusting The bread was ok but the pastries were of the cheap variety I would expect much better from a 4 star property but I think it s really a 3 star The room was lovely very modern beds were very comfy Perfect location for access to monmartre and abbesses,1
 Small room Friendly Staff,1
 Staff not very friendly or helpful Style of hotel Position,1
 Restaurant a little expensive Hip hammock in room great bed and shower next to train station,1
 lighting was too low room was small the bed was cean the bathroom also,0
"Great host,amazing location and spotless house.<br/>It was a lovely experience overall<br/>Super convenient check in and check out",1
 Room too small breakfast limited choice In the room no place to do some work desk missing chair missing  good bed clean room friendly people,0
 Wifi was really bad The very first day we had breakfast We were severy dissapointed by it as it did not include anything spanish and as well as the food was underwhelming compared to the price From next days we started eaiting at a nearby bakery which was really good Compared to the room price it did not offer any facilities in the hotel such as pool or good gym  The neighbourhood was really quite and subway was really close Room was properly maintained everyday ,1
 The cleanlees of the room  The size of the room and the quite relaxing area,1
 Inside the room sometime are not comfortable when something happen outside because we can hear the sound  Hotel staffs are very helpfull and they speak English fluenly,1
 Car park charge of 50 which we were not aware of There are no signs to tell you that charge exists Or that you have to pay at reception Staff were very very unhelpful It needs to be made clearer on the websirte and before entering the carpark Would never have gone there Will not return No Positive,0
  The view is amazing and the room was clean,0
No Negative I like the interior design,1
 Having to get the refrigerator unlocked upon getting to the hotel as well as having to request the remote be delivered to the room Wifi also was inconsistent  Clean well decorated very accommodating Breakfast was delicious ,1
 I thought some of the photos on the website were misleading For example the room looked massive on the website but was fairly standard in reality Also the photos showed a pool in the spa but there isn t a pool there is a projection of a pool from a projector located in the ceiling projecting rippling water onto the floor Hugely disappointing  The location was absolutely stunning The decor within the hotel was funky and classy I loved it There is a lot of space in the main areas of the hotel and you are encouraged to sit and chill Doesn t feel like you re in central London at all very relaxing ,1
 I requested for a room with some views was given a room with very limited view The pillows are too flat The staff at breakfast not very pleasant they send you to the back of the room when there s not even a table available Bad internet connection  The proximity to the centre of town The people of Vienna are very pleasant ,0
 All Nothing,0
 Housekeeping carts always in hall Minimal common space Design and style Room functionality and natural light,1
 Additional charge for breakfast seemed high after paying 250 for the room Unique boutique hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Good location ,1
 No comment Location,1
 Nothing Everything,1
 Overpriced paid for upgraded larger room which was tiny and bathroom miniscule Was credited back the upgrade cost but 17 00 for glass of wine and a pint and 19 00 pp for breakfast Taxi and tube fares meant it would have been worth paying more for staying in Zone 1 as we did on previous visit If you are visiting theatres expect 30 for taxis Hotel was up to standard but nothing special and rooms were tiny,0
 The hotel rooms were extremely cold even with the heaters on Our rooms were at the front of the building so the noise from trams and students leaving local club was excessive  The hotel was well situated and within walking distance of everything ,0
 I would almost call it a scam the pictures are not reflecting the actual rooms From the pictures you expect a brand new modern boutique style accommodation but you get 20 to 25 year old rooms  Friendly staff good breakfast,0
 The bathroom was so small that I burned my leg on the towel heater twice The room was so small that there was hardly room for the bed and one armchair It was very awkward trying to move around the luggage on the racks in the room  Outlaws restaurant,0
 Unfortunately our room was adjacent to and over looked the building site next door that is not the hotel s fault but be aware of this  Staff are extremely friendly and helpful Plenty of choice for breakfast and all very fresh ,1
 Nothing  Nice compact hotel near lots of lovely restaurants and sights ,1
 The completly unexpected 150 deposit on top of out payment for the room it completly ruined our holiday as we had very little spemding money left after it Was no where on the booking com website We also asked for a double room but got two single beds pushed together with 2 single duvets it felt like we were sleeping on rocks Not a hotel for couples  Easy to get to on the tram not far from the city center ,0
 Going home The Restaurant manager forgot her name Was absolutely fantastic We complimented her for the wonderful food variety and service So she called out the head chef so we could talk with him A fellow South Africa and absolute gent Lovely hotel Highly recommended ,1
 Room was just big enough to move around absolutely no space to lay your luggage open No kettle provided Upon request it was brought up but again gotta requesf for a cup No cofee tea in the room either Hairdryer was difficult to use gotta press hard onto the button to operate it and irs very heavy  Location cleanliness nice atmosphere ,0
No Negative We loved the breakfast bags Every evening they give you a paper bag which you hang on a hook placed outside your door In the morning you find yogurt banana and juice are waiting for you A great perk ,1
 The worst was the receptionist We explicitly asked whether the trains to the airport were running normally he pretended to looked in the system and assured us all was good Having trusted him we arrived at the train station only to be told that that weekend due to planned works on the tracks no trains were running We scrambled to make it to the airport which cost us extra money and we barely made our flight He simply lied into my face which I find unacceptable  The location of the hotel is superb right on the subway nice area cafes and restaurants all over The rooms are of good size ,1
  Big rooms easy traveling to center ,1
 We had a connecting room and the soundproofing was inadequate which meant that we could easily hear the couple next door  The staff and the well equipped gym ,1
 Room keys are totally  Everything was really beautiful ,1
 Staff didn t want to listen Everything was at a extra cost Rip off hotel  Treated like a dog they asked me if I wanted a upgrade a room with a view 20 when I got in the room the windows were absolutely filthy could hardly see through them the room wasn t munch better I arrive on my motorcycle I did state this on my comments then they changed me 21 for 1 night I asked to see the manager who was really arrogant and didn t really want to waste his time discussing 21 as he was too busy 5 minutes later he was standing at the bar with his staff drinking ,0
 The room was very small for a superior room Even for a double I have had larger single rooms in the pastNo Positive,0
 Room next to the lift very noisy Lovely cookies on arrival,1
No Negative The hotel was modern stylish immaculate and had a friendly atmosphere It was in a good situation the neighbourhood is safe and it is within walking distance of everything After one night we had already booked to move to a posh hotel up the road but after a couple of nights there I wish I had stayed my whole time in Barcelona at this hotel It is extremely good value for money ,1
 The weather  Staff were all very polite and professional Room very comfortable hotel easy to reach from London City Airport and a 2 minute walk to the nearest tube station Would definitely stay here again a perfect base for sight seeing either on foot or by tube The chocolates and birthday card in my room was such a lovely gesture ,1
 staff in the mask bar unfriendly great location and clean rooms very quiet ,1
 Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set No Positive,0
No Negative Staff very helpful when one of out party fell ill and needed to stay longer in the room Thankyou,1
 Requested room near lift and they assumed I was disable and had walk in shower but room was on GF by reception too noisey Staff quickly changed for me which I was grateful however as I entered the room it had unpleasant smell as the bathroom toilet had no ventilation Bedroom also was blocked off with brickwall which was depressing Disappointed as last stay I was extremely pleased Hope they don t only treat first time guests well Gym was basement and as you enter the floor it smells of heavy dampness Gym treadmill inclined but couldn t come back down TV worked immitenently but no sound  The cleanliness the staff attitude is fantastic Parking availability on site ,1
 Matters so badNo Positive,1
 Location and room service menu Room and pool area,0
 the decor was dated conversations between rooms can be heard easily the wifi would partially work in the rooms there was a pungent odor from the bathroom or exterior  the location is excellent the customer service was friendly and very helpful ,0
 I dialed the housekeeping number on the phone two dozen times but it was never answered Also I was not informed before hand that the mini bar was included in the room rate hence I did not use it at all  The view of the River from the window was lovely The room received good sun shine ,0
 SPA acess prices Breakfast Staff,0
 Noise railway station atmosphere messy out of date rooms stained room carpets disappointing overall quality for such a high name hotel chain Expensive on site car parking  Not very much but great breakfast ,0
 The price was a bit high otherwise all okNo Positive,0
 Tiny rooms Place needs refurbishing Convenient location off Oxford Street ,0
 A bit difficult connection from the airport with 2 changes  Very nice room with a great view from the 9th floor Bathtub and a large bed ,1
 The location is best for business rather than for journeying into the central city Be prepared to walk or take a taxi into town or the train station The shuttle for the airport is also infrequent so we had to take a taxi Be careful of their connecting restaurant The Harbour Kitchen it s connected to the hotel but is its own thing and a terrible value  Super great breakfast that was also a great value The hotel had a nice gym and the whole hotel was nicely furnished and maintained The room itself was a good size and it was really nice to enjoy a bath after a long day out Great value for the price and the staff was always willing to help out ,1
 Bigger roomNo Positive,1
No Negative This hotel is fabulous in every way and the staff are very attentive and look after all your requirements ,1
No Negative The room was amazing Atmosphere in the hotel was superb ,1
 The room was too smallNo Positive,1
No Negative Hotel staff was very nice I personally do not like modern design and the room accommodations were very modern The a c was not as cold as I like In the late afternoon room was little warm Hotel was clean and service was great Located across the street form the park so it was a lovely location ,1
 Our room number was 334 and this was a horrible dark room with small size small double bed tacky furniture white tiled old fashined dirty bathroom and only one window We have asked for a change but reception people asked for extra money They have not changed our room till the last day of our stay which we can not appreciate since hotel was the worst memory we had in Vienna Room service did not change our bedding for 6 days  Location and breakfast were great During the six days stay we only have one good experience with the hotel staff Heba who has changed our room with a suit on the 6th day ,0
 It s not a 4 star hotel It s a modest 3 star that could be renovated  Location is good as in 10 minutes you are in the centre of Vienna Staff was very friendly ,1
 Although the train station is extremely close it is a bit of a hike to the city s center Small things felt a little off like the toilet seat in our bathroom wasn t properly fastened and there was always a loud clunk when you walked into the elevator but nothing that was a deal breaker  Room came with an excellent tub since moving to Italy I haven t had my own tub Room was exactly as pictured Breakfast was plentiful and diverse Tons of parking We arrived early and the staff allowed us to register early and leave our car and luggage Within spitting distance of the train station Good value for money ,1
 Very bad quality in everything Staff clean and services We had problem with the hotel and when we contact with the manager he want helpful and he didn t help us in anything and he didn t listen to us My advice to any one is to not book in this hotel because it is very bad hotel in every thing No Positive,0
 breakfast too expensive for what s on offer awesome location spacious luxurious rooms with comfy beds modern and stylish impressive Grand Etage with fantastic view,1
 We had 14 degree in our room over night it was problem with window old windows so you can ask for second quilt when you fill frozen or to sleep in sweater  near of centrum free refreshment water mufin snacks tee on the room friendly staff,0
 Maybe just when I first checked in and when I tried to pay admin bond fee the system said my card declined bit I knew I had available funds may have been a small system glitch A minor hiccup  Breakfast buffet was awesome staff very helpful and professional Room reasonable size and quiet which was really good Elevators nice and spacious and not waiting for long time for an elevator Staff friendly approachable helpful graceful and professional ,1
 Nothing could have been better Brilliant hotel in an excellent location Beautifully clean rooms and very friendly and helpful staff Will definitely stay here again ,1
"I stayed here with my --yo daughter for a week at the end of October including - days hunkered down during Hurricane Sandy
Excellent hotel which handled the Hurricane superbly
Tip-join the Presidents Club on checking in which is free and gives you free internet in the room,free gym and other benefits
Superb Breakfasts-we did bed and breakfast
Price good-far cheaper than nearby Four Seasons
Excellent Concierge Desk very helpful with restraunys etc
Tip-get metro plastic travel card to save moeny and use on metro and all buses",1
 I didn t like the style of the room as we were given the room next to the lift and so was T shaped making it feel small I liked the comfort of the bed and the location of hotel,0
 Nothing Everything,1
 Everything was great Staff was extremely helpful Room was clean but rather small We had superior room with a bit of more space compared to standard room Bed was super comfortable Saw comments that bathroom is extremely small It was small but I didn t feel lack of space Everything was neat and clean Location of the hotel is great Lots of eating places and bars You could do some shopping as well there are a lot of clothes stores in the area Hotel is close to Bastille station and 10 mins drive from Gare du Nord ,1
 Breakfast Brilliant location and quality of rooms,1
 The room was extremely small and there was a large stain on the carpet  Bathroom was nicely decorated ,0
 Not having breakfast included for the price Very stylish room with a huge bed,1
"The bathrooms were showing age, beds very comfortable. Rooms small but that's New York. The staff were very nice. Location is good. Had no problem with any noise from the street. Slept like a baby. Overall very happy with my stay,",1
 Bad smell in the room The view and the Heights restaurant,0
No Negative Everything,1
"The price was cheap, and rightly so! Very loud. Situated between an on-ramp and an on-ramp so no wonder. Without earplugs, good luck. Staff was nice, and were willing to let us check out a day early (we found a room for the same price via -rd party Internet site...much better). Room was clean, but very worn. All linen needs replacement. Parking is very limited, and though we did walk to the Gaslamp district it didn't seem like a great place to be walking around.

"I'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room. The hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you're staying in your grandmother's attic. Wallpaper is peeling off the wall, not well lit, very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones (none next to the bed or built into lamps), terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at -am. Even the location is off the beaten path - closest L stop is on the Red Line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring. Health club is not on site either. There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one.",0

"The main problem i had with this hotel was that our room was tiny. It was, basically, a single room, with a double bed in it (and not much room for anything else). There was no where to hang up more than a couple of coats, so, we lived out of our suitcases for - days (which we had to keep moving about to make space). 
Also, the pipes made a racket, first thing in the morning.
However, it is in an ideal location (a minutes walk from Broadway). So, for the price we paid for the room, it was a bargin. But, i really wouldn't recommend this hotel because the rooms were so small. 
Our next stop was the 'Comfort Inn' in Downtown Memphis, the rooms were massive, good breakfast included, free internet access (I would definately recommend that hotel!)
Good luck in finding a good hotel!",0
 The people at reception made me pay my stay the night of my arrival during check in This was clearly not nice and not an appropriate way to welcome a guest especially at 11pm when you are exhausted The bedroom and bathroom were not very clean sheets sink and shower The bedroom was small in comparison to what the pictures showed and the price of the room  The bed was quite comfortable and breakfast looked fine although I didn t have a chance to try it ,0
 Otherwise simply not good value for the price  The location is perfect for anyone attending an event at the RAI convention center The Wi Fi connection is free and fast ,0
 Just 2 small things neither of which would put us off staying there again 1 There was a leak of some sort under the carpet near the bathroom so the carpet was very wet at that point 2 The hotel bar does not serve peach bellini but we were not told for 30mins after which point we were running too late for cocktails and had to leave for our evening event not a big issue but it would have been nice to have what we had ordered the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful the bed was very comfortable and the style inside the room and the arty hotel generally was really great,1

The online rate was better than the actual reservation rate over the telephone and the reservation specialist was honest about it. The lobby looks fabulous and the complimentary breakfast was out of this world good. The staff was very welcoming on all shifts. DOWNSIDE: There was a washcloth left in our bathtub with personal hair on it. The temperature of the room was hot, uncomfortable and not controllable by us (we stayed ----- so it was cold out). When I told the front desk about it the next day, they offered the suggestion to put the heat on economy and leave the windows open...",0
 We booked a small double room Did not expect it to be that small considering the price More of a cupboard Just enough room to squeeze in a double bed Could only access the bed from one side and no room to open a suitcase Earlier in the week we stayed at the Hilton 5 minutes down the road and had a large newly refurbished room with a great view over London for the same price we paid here at the Mercure  We stayed here as it is next door to Paddington station and easy for us to get to Heathrow,0
 To say its a 4 star hotel things were very dated Old carpets old tv chipped paint and wobbly windows could all do with replacing and the bed was very small Comfortable but small  The location is brilliant only 10 mins to the theatre and very close to the tube but a lovely quiet area Staff were very nice and everything was very clean ,1

 There were absolutely no bad experiences at the Egerton House  The Egerton House was a wonderful respite in London after traveling through the country In contrast to some negative comments about the staff we found all of the staff to be very engaged and very helpful They were extremely helpful in finding a physician for both of us because we both had developed sinus infections while traveling But their service and help went well beyond that Everyone was always courteous and very responsive to all of our requests The location of Egerton House is excellent but yet it is located in a quiet beautiful neighborhood It was like having our own pied de terre in London We will definitely return there on our next London visit ,1

 The breakfast was appalling not glasses for juice knife to eat bacon sausages or tomatoes we had to ask for everything so our breakfast came out in stages i e I had a rasher of bacon then a sausage and then just gave up on the rest The lady looking after the dining room was to busy trying to tick residents off her list instead of organising our breakfast  The room was as it said in the advert a small double it was perfectly sized and had everything I needed in it,0

"We stayed again at the Orchard Hotel in late April, ----, and had another good experience (we've stayed there - or - times over the last several years). I like the readily accessible internet service, my wife likes the proximity of shopping and the closeness to Union Square, and we both appreciate the comfortable rooms and furnishings. We got a great rate from an internet special offer. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. No doubt we'll return next time we're in San Francisco.",1
"This hotel is now a LaQuinta. We stayed here the last weekend in April. The room was clean, but the public areas and hallway right outside of our first floor non-smoking room were very smoky-smelling. Smoking is not allowed in the public areas (thank goodness) so the smoking rooms must share the same ventilation system. We could not smell it in the bedroom portion of the room, but we could in the bathroom and vanity area near the door. The morning breakfast was great - my -YO loved the make-it-yourself waffles -- and the smell of waffles cooking masked the smoke smell in the lobby during the morning hours. I thought the front desk was a bit understaffed (only one employee per shift all weekend), but they were very nice and accommodating.",0

Accommodation - Could do with a lick of paint and a bit of an update but on the whole it was satisfactory for our short stay from --th October til --th October.
Room was cleaned everyday, fresh towels, beds made etc. It would have been nice to have tea-coffee making facilities in the room but there is a cafe downstairs to get a take out.",0

No Negative Frendly atmosphere location excellent,1
 On entering the hotel one has to run the gauntlet of smokers take a deep breath before approaching the entrance doors to avoid their fumes The mattress on the bed had seen better days It was too soft and had a hollow in the middle This is unusual for Holiday Inns they are normally good This was dire and we both rolled together in the centre of the bed Not a good nights sleep at all The location of the hotel is ideal just one block from the tube or fifteen minutes walk from the centre The breakfasts were very well cooked the scrambled eggs were soft and creamy the sausages were tasty the black pudding was not too fatty or made with too much cereal ,0

 Too hard to communicate with the housekeeping and the operator they only speak spanish there cleaning level is poor to normal Please improve this side It is really hard to ask from them what we need The blue lightning in the floor between the rooms were awful The receptionist were excellent they speak English The smell of the place beautiful Rishad best employee ever There is one shopping mall near to this facility ,1
"This lovely hotel is just a few blocks from Union Square. The room was nice, beds comfortable, housekeeping well done. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The price was excellent for the location and amenities. The location was a surprise - despite being very central and on a fairly busy street, the rooms were quiet, which was great after a good day of walking and sight-seeing. The central location also helped with transportation - access to transit, taxi and rental car were all within a few blocks. I'd recommend this hotel and will stay again when I visit.",1
 No elevator  Everything ,1
 Extra charge for wi fi Parking overload when asked in reception where else to park they directed us to a private parking which would cost appx 20 euros per day it cost 44 4 euros for 26 hours When compained we received complimantery wi fi vouchers They know that people have paid about 75 euros on surrounding private parkings  Location rooms are nice ,0
 I had booked my stay basedvan a price of 78 00 and when the booking went though the price was 216 00 browser update the hotel would not accept my genuine explanation and I had to pay 216 00 As the hotel clearly accepted that they would accept 78 90 they would not accept my genuine request Exasperating No Positive,0
 the hotel is absolutely not at the standards of a 4 The receptionnist was not competent even if he was trying to help We had booked a family room and they gave us 2 double rooms he said they did not have any but actually it appears they were not usable We tried to change for a triple which would have allowed us to stay together but they gave a room that was already occupied imagine the face of the woman when we entered her room In each room there is a fridge for champagne just next to the bed which is terribly noisy and honestly quite useless I would not recommend this hotel  nothing,0

 The polar reception Good location for Paddington and quiet,0
 We were upgraded God only knows what our room would have been like The rooms are tired and furniture tatty very little comfort given today s hotel standards Ridiculously expensive we may as well have booked a Premier Inn For the amount we paid 180 for one night I d have expected breakfast There are way better and more reasonable hotels in London  I can t think of anything I liked The location is ok The doorman was friendly ,0

Issue with the room was sorted as soon as they could. Help by offering us free water and Breakfast as compensation. Staff where always helpful and rooms where a good size but as others have said before rooms were on the small side. Great Location to most attractions. I would definitely stay here again. Food in Rare was very good and tasty and bar staff and resturant staff helpful. Only issue was I forgot my dress and a new jumper and sweater rang hotel as soon as i was aware and was told no sigh of it but would look into it for me further.,0
 Given a very small room on my arrival Probably the smallest hotel room I ve ever seen I could not turn around in the shower as it was so tight  Good atmosphere strange layout in the hotel but added to the atmosphere Bar attached was good Staff very friendly knowledgeable and helpful Concierge from Hungary was excellent ,0

 Breakfast is too expensive almost 20 euros per person  The hotel s location is excellent near Arc du Triomphe and Champs Elys es There s a metro station 2 minutes away which is also very nice as well as all sorts of places to eat or have a coffee All in all it s a good value for the money It s a nice clean comfortable place The room was quiet tastefully decorated and with a good size for a couple The wi fi worked perfectly for both of us ,1
 The room was abnormally small It was advertised as a double and I paid more for the size Unfortunately the room was miniscule There is no way two people could even be in the room at the same time This is mis advertising at its worst You literally could not sit forward on the toilet as it was so close to the wall The room was a single at best and should NEVER be advertised as a double I felt cheated and upset There was also a fight in the hall at 12 30 AM Overall I was very disappointed as the room was NOT as advertised  The room was clean ,0
"I was very disappointed with my room! It smelled like death and smoke! Old style decor! Old sink with tacky pipes showing underneth sink. Outside corridor was old and smelly! Terrible view, unless you like early Parking lot! I stayed at Motel - motels that were better! I believe because I was with a Company seminar class and because my company paid in advanced, the Hotel gave me the room a tad above the Bates Motel!....",0
No Negative Good breakfast Excellent food in restaurant,1
 Bathroom needed updating  Friendly staff Nice view ,1
 The room size terrible no little perks you got nothing for the price no snacks included confusing to find facilities got lost walking around nothing sign posted shallow end pool far to deep wouldn t recommend to a friend  Bed was very comfortable the jacuzzi was fun,0
 I paid extra for a panoramic room but that is just an room with a large window facing another building so you have to keep the shutters closed anyway Not really added value The noise in the room was around 50 db in the morning when the traffic started and that woke me up at 6 30 in the morning I paid 15 euros for the parking per night which was ok but i was not informed on these costs beforehand Complained about the noise but sofar no reaction received All in all for the visit and the money next time I will find a hotel nearer the centre with no big window  comfortable room bit different than standard hotel rooms ,0
 Pathetic room absolutely pathetic super duper duper small didnot look like anything in the pictures They dont even have a person to carry the bags They gave me early checkin as requested ,0

 The pillows were very odd shaped and 4 days later I still have a very painful neck injury from the last night of stay at the hotel Pillows are normally rectangular and flat so as not to cause injury A pity because the hotel is good otherwise  INK is in a great location and is handy to attractions tour bookings and facilities like laundromat and convenience store There is a one drawer fridge which is handy for milk or water in the room We used it a lot because we only drink bottled water on our international trip Also having real milk instead the UHT crap for tea was a blessing ,0
"Our room was a little dim and cramped but generally fine. The hotel seemed safe-secure, the breakfast was quite decent, and the location was pretty good, being right around the corner from the Walk of Fame etc. Good value for what and where it is.",0
 rooms on the main square quite noisy due to traffic no cleaning or change of towels if you stay for more than 3 days coffee machine could be upgraded and or coffee powder and filters could be provided very nice and helpfull staff,1

 Nothing  Impeccable Perfect in every aspect Faultless Truly a wonderful stay Everyone from the Doorman to the Guest Experience Executive were warm professional helpful I had a luxurious single room with all the modern amenities required for a very comfortable stay Outstanding As for location there is no better in Central London in my opinion This is a truly Champaign Experience which I intend to repeat They have won a loyal customer Bravo to the Management Staff ,1
 it was first time i saw a hanging shower with hair on it fortunately they had a hand shower that i could use the gym is a indoor pool a bike and wheight machine not enough room for more also but calling it a gym  the breakfast is great I also had dinner in the hotel bar and it was a very nice omolete the location is perfect for airport accessibility 15min with hotel FREE bus shuttle ,1
 Heating in Room very old fashioned could not work it out Very central had free up grade but feel the hotel need s some tender loving care ie carpets shabby need to up grade from shower curtain s to screen more waiting staff on For peak time for breakfast two girls rushed off there feet where unable to give the service for 4 star ratings,1
 The staff made were rude and our apparent was double instead of twins and not located within the hotel Breakfast was manic and not worth the money  Location was good,0
 the very first day I didn t get a map the staff could have offer the map to see the city in the very first day just as a courtesy without waiting for the guest to ask for directions the scramble eggs are not well cooked I loved the bed and the pillow very confortable,1
No Negative It is my hotel whenever I visit Amsterdam My answers to the questionnaire tell s you why,1

 Old room reeking with cigarette smoke and broken air conditioning At 425 night this was my worst and the most expensive stay No Positive,0
 Unclean found a bunch of hair on a towel I left the towel on the floor to be changed and I marked it I found the same towel on the towel rail I found a cockroach in the room Too expensive parking rate I waited one week for the amount of money blocked as a guarantee to be put back in my credit card account For the double room there was only one card key given therefore if only one person leaves the room the other person either remains in the dark or the first person cannot get back to the room because the elevator needs the card key to be operated For a double room too there was only one soap bar only one shower cap and only one body milk tube  Quiet environment,0
 ToiletNo Positive,0
 Breakfast few options and poor value so decided to go out shame Rooms amazing a whole place was relaxed,1

 Further from the city centre than I realised although that s probably my fault The room was very basic a bit sad there was no kettle or tea or coffee in the room The decoration of the room didn t match the cool vibrance of the communal areas but these are nit picky points it served it s purpose very well  Very comfy bed Very clean Liked the decoration and interior of the communal areas ,0
 Smell of smoke in bedroom and corridors was very bad Empty bottles and trays left in stairwell on 11th floor all weekend No Positive,0
 Service in restaurant for both breakfast and dinner was poor for a 5 star hotel  good location and nice rooms ,0
 Minor inconvenience for me but there are 4 or 5 steps down as soon as you enter the main door so not good for people with limited mobility There may be another entrance for wheelchairs but it wasn t obvious The elevators and the area next to them in the lobby are dark but I think it is intended to evoke a mood  I am not gay but I thought it wonderful that this hotel is a safe and welcoming place for people that might other experience discrimination elsewhere I wish them every success Location is good as it is just two blocks away from one of the stops that the airport bus makes and a few minutes walk to the main tourist strip ,1
 Noisy cleaners outside our room every morning Nice view from our room on the seventh floor,1

 the breakfast could have been better another BW hotel closeby has a much better offering at the breakfast Location was perfect very close to a major park and metro station ,1
 breakfast is not international standard both in offer and service and therefore much too expansive the use of sauna needs to inform reception 15mn ahead but when calling the operator about the service she will not tell you and you discover it once you are in front of the door already in bath suit  location and private parking,0

"Noisiest hotel I've ever stayed in. Even on the --th floor, we could hear voices from the street like some sort of party happening. Sirens, honking cars, screaming people. This went on till way past midnight. Same thing on my last visit, but wrote it off to the exception, but apparently the noise is the rule. Windows are just too thin.

"Worst hotel ever. I only give it one star because I don't know how to give it a lower ranking. In general the rooms were outdated and the staff was unhelpful. Specifically, our hotel room flooded and we believe the staff stole a ring from our room (which we promptly reported). Not only did the staff fail to fix these problems but the hotel staff didn't even apologize for our terrible experience, let alone try to make it right.",0
 Wifi in the rooms is not strong Great Location friendly staff and good services Competent and efficient concierge,1

"The room was clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The problem we had was that the people in the neighboring room partied most of the night on the --th---th, with loud voices and slamming of doors. Someone else in the party arrived at -:-- AM with loud discussions on the balcony. There was less noise on the --th---st, but still the -:--AM arrival of another individual and loud discussion on the balcony. I had not seen any security personnel in the parking lot, so assumed I just needed to create white noise. On Sunday before leaving, I reported the noise to the manager, Gabriel, and he noted the problem and also stated that I should have called the front desk. Probably so, but it did interrupt our sleep time. Reporting did not seem an option to me. Otherwise, things were good-average. I appreciated the cleanliness of the room.",0
 The hotel is easy to miss as you walk on the street so keep eye out The rooms are very compact and there is not real privacy when you are in the bathroom as there is not a locking door between the room and bathroom We also noticed our carpets were not vacummed in the room  The staff were friendly and the hotel was opposite one of the main train stations It is quite easy to get metros and there are lots of bakeries and eateries nearby ,0

 We were there when the temperature was 5c and should have asked for the heating to be turned up a minor issue  We enjoyed the ambience of the hotel and the breakfasts the staff helpful and amiable gave good advice and guidance on local activities The bed was very comfortable and by upgrading we were in a pleasant and spacious room with a canal view The location was excellent a simple bus journey to and from nearby to the airport and frequent trams into the centre of the City The galleries and museums area is nearby and there is a huge choice of eateries within a short stroll And the concierge was particular kind about providing help with forgotten medication ,1
 They wrongly book for us 2 rooms and we asked for 3 rooms they fix it later on Location,0
No Negative Everything,1
"Our room was fine, but the lights seemed too dim. Maybe some lightbulbs were burned out. The breakfast was good. This motel's location is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it's very close to the airport and Graceland. On the other hand, the neighborhood around this motel isn't the greatest.",0

 Breakfast not included Website said we could have two adults and a child in the double room but we were forced to upgrade to a triple at check in or threatened to have to purchase a second room which may or may not be available It ended up quite expensive  The beds were very comfortable and the hotel location was great,0
 If you want a room with a view you will need to pay for it Avoid the first floor as street noise from people will cause problems to a light sleeper  Very good location albeit in the less desirable Raval neighbourhood Walking distance or a couple of metro stops from all the attractions Very modern hotel with huge comfy beds power shower ,1

 Nearer the tube station  Clean comfortable hotel ,1
 It always annoyes me to arrive at a hotel and find that I have been mis lead This hotels boasts 4 and a half stars It is a 2 star hotel even by Paris standards The room was barely 9sq metres The chair could not be pulled out without hitting the bed The bed and pillows had the comfort of an autopsy table Everything about this hotel is dark cramped and depressing For nearly AU300 a night I had the right to expect much more We got out as soon as possible thanks to booking com and found a beautiful 3 star hotel in the theatre district The contrast was startling If you want to ruin your stay in Paris this place is for you otherwise keep looking  The staff we courteous and understanding The only redeeming feature,0

 Cleanliness of the bath ceiling was falling apart noise in the room next door until 1am smoking in the hallway  Location was as described ,0
 I made reservation via booking which allowed me free cancellation until day before arrival For some reason the whole amount for our stay was already charged when we came I don t know if it is a hotel or booking com new policy but this is the first time it happened I was concerned because I wanted to pay with different card and only after I see the room When I pointed it out at the reception they were ready to offer me a different solution and very helpful  Although there is still work in progress at the hotel building we didn t hear anything Reception guys are very kind and friendly and offering welcome popsicles while checking in was nice touch We liked absolutely everything room comfort modern and funny design hotel stuff and we are definitely coming back ,1
 The original room was sold as a Superior Double with a queen sized bed The room we were given was small with a standard double bed We complained and after a bit of arguing were given an upgrade with two singles pushed together The room had no tea or coffee making facilities and no hairdryer Both rooms were in need of refreshing  Location was very handy for the tube and local restaurants The manager changed our room to a larger Executive Double from the Superior Double when we complained about the bed size and grubby room standard Liked the free glass of prosecco in the evening ,0
 never had the chance to get a room with a proper view  Perfect location,1
 We did not pay for WIFI as we felt this should be available to those who had booked a room without paying an additional cost  Excellent view from our room over the Thames towards the City and Canary Wharf ,1
 Parking arrangements could be clearer on booking  The staff were very professional and helpful but also very friendly often it is one or the other but this was a great combination The room was clean quiet and very comfortable Overall it was just great ,1
"We stayed over a weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a blast but the hotel is severely overpriced for what it is. 
Back when the hotel first opened, it must have been the jewel of Pacific Beach. Today it is in dire need of remodeling. Everything is old, except for a decent flatscreen tv and alarm clock. 
Beds are not comfortable, towels are old and look dirty, bathroom is small and run down, the roof on some of the buildings looks like it survived a nuclear bomb.
On the plus side, you are only one block from the beach, staff was very friendly, the bar and restaurant are very affordable and good, and the fitness center is actually very nice. 
Overall, I would stay here again only if the room was --% less than what I payed.",0

"My stay was only for one night: I wish I'd more time at my disposal. Staff were smiling and helpful without being obtrusive; the setting, including amenities like a roof-top pool, were equal to a five stars' hotel. Of course, Colorado is one of the most beautiful states, (but on my return, the accommodations elsewhere were not comparable.)",1

No Negative The hotel is very tidy easy to reach by metro in the centre of Vienna s shopping life which was especially important The breakfast was brilliant I especially liked the variety of viennoiserie jams smoothies cheese and the impeccable frothy melange An electric teapot was a great advantage One more important thing it was really quiet no noise heard either from neighbours or from outside ,1
"This is a great hotel. I stayed in the Loft section of the hotel and it honestly felt my own little townhouse. The staff was very nice and the location is obviously great - Gaslamp is where you want to be in SD and it is very easy to get on the freeways to hit the other spots (La Jolla, Del Mar). Highly recommend this hotel",1
 We had absolutely no hot water and the staff were aware there is none when we checked in but failed to tell us There was still not hot water the following morning and only received 50 refund after a lot of complaining and arguing the minimum expectations of a hotel  The decor was good,0

 It was hard to find the parking white walls paint in the room were dirty I assume from bag scratches carpet ends were becoming loose stairs leading to the reception were dirty Certainly one is not expecting to notice such things in a 5 hotel Also it was very disturbing that at 9 30 in the morning cleaning lady knocked on the door and while I was heading to open to my surprise she just used her card to open it herself  We liked the view to the city nespresso cofee machine in the room nice restaurant ,0
"Okay..bought this through Hotwire..where I usually have so much success. But this hotel is dated, dirty , linens are gross. Don't expect much from an airport hotel..but this is one you need to beware!~",0
 Main train station is just 5min away in evening not so nice place to walk around Windows to very noisy street during all day time so not possible to open it but prety nice air conditioning so it helps  Good for 1 night stay very good if you are just in transit via Vienna if more nights would advise more nicer places in Vienna Standart economy number but just walls and furniture in reallity is more obsolate than on photos It was rainy and in the reception were available umbrelas big ,1

 The hotel staff tried to pretend that there is no booking through your website until I provided a copy of the booking confirmation I wasn t welcomed well because of the discounted value through booking com The hotel did not care about the daily cleaning of my room Plus the keys were given to me in a stapled paper instead of the well known paper pocket and I considered that as disrespect and disvalue to the guest Finally the staff never smile or give the feeling of welcome to the guest  The location of the hotel and the outside room environment was very clean and the cost was reasonable ,0

"After looking at over -- hotels on the computer, I picked the sanctuary. the location was great. Parking was directly across the street and cheaper than the other hotels had quoted in times square. the staff was outstanding. Everyone was pleasant and super helpful. hotel rooms were very modern and super clean. I would have to say that everything about this hotel was absolutely perfect except I prefer a bigger room (although, the layout of the room was great for its size). If you want a more personal experience from a staff that seems to genuinely care, this is the place. Being in a place like New York for the first time, it was nice not to have to have any stress over the hotel accomadations or parking. I will not even inquire of another location on a return trip unless they are sold out.",1

 Nothing  This hotel was a good value for the price The area is far enough from the city center to avoid the party crowd but close enough to the better restaurants I read a bunch of reviews before booking this place and some complained about noise in the basement rooms which has I fully understand now because I passed by those rooms numerous times and can imagine how annoying that would be if I was on the bottom floor Bottom line book this place if you re not a ground level the rooms types let you choose ,1

It offers a nice happy hour and some limited but acceptable food options. There is a small pool, although I did not use. The rooms are small and a bit worn given the age of this hotel, but have everything needed including a fridge. The staff is friendly and helpful.

 Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good  Location is great,0

When we arrived, the receptionist said he upgraded us to a one-bedroom suite. Upon entering the room, we were blown away by the spaciousness and view--nearly every window had a view of the Empire State Building! My husband and I were so impressed, that we regretted that we had only booked one night at the hotel.
Also, we thought it would be a great hotel for families. The pull-out couch provides more sleeping space. Plus, the kitchenette makes it possible to eat in and save some money.",1

After having such a wonderful stay in Memphis we checked out or tried to check out of the heartbreak hotel only to be told we hadn't payed our bill. This was of course payed for before we left the UK. The women on the reception desk was very rude and decided she was going to take the payment from our credit card.never give the hotel your credit card just hand over $-- its safer than a credit card. When we arrived back in the UK two more attemps were made on our card. What should have been a wonderful stay was spoilt by this gastly receptionist. This was our -th visit and our last.,0

 I stayed there for 4 nights and I booked 2 rooms there was no kettle in the rooms and when i asked for a hot water and i took only one English breakfast tea bag they charged me for 5 euros which is not reasonable as the the whole pack is less than 5 euros and it contains much more Also there was insects that you can t see but it pinch in the room from the frist night so we couldn t sleep and I asked them for a spray for those insects they provided me but the problem was that it didn t kill those insects and we spent the 4 nights almost without sleeping because of that  Only the location,0

Would easily recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Saigon.",1

 Everything was perfect even the butler This is by far the best hotel in the world and I have stayed in many The staff were absolutely fabulous there s nothing they couldn t do From start to finish the whole experience was perfect and so was the Champagne I took my Mother here for her 50th Birthday and the wonderful staff catered to our every need we stayed for 2 nights in the Junior suite 9th floor and the slight view we had of the Thames was wonderful I would also recommend when choosing a cocktail ask for the pop up cocktail book and try a Grey Goose tipple I can t remember the name I had a few too many Only a few minutes walk from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery and a mile away from Regent street perfect location ,1
 Room was very small for a superior room room amenities were quite modest We couldnt change the climate function heat AC on the the thermostat climate control we can only the change temperature and turn it on off breakfast section was too small and pricy for the options available It s a cozy boutique hotel but quite expensive for what it offers frankly not worth the value for money All in all the only convenience for us was the location  Location was very central and has easy access to champs elysees Staff were friendly but seems to be a one or two man show ,0
 Damp smell in corridor bathroom a little tiered view poor Lift beds,0
 The overall quality of services and accomondations do not correspond with the price In addition there is a gap between what how things are being advertised on booking com and the reality To name a few disappointments frontdesk receiption is not a 4 stars standard some facilities inside the bathroom are broken insufficient tolietary stuff in the bathroom smaller size of the room than being advertised on the website higher charge of the breakfast in reality than being advertised on the website etc  The interior deco is fairly modern and spacious building ,0

"Staying at Boston Park Plaza for - nights from October --th. really made our - nights stay in and around Boston perfect.
The staff at the lobby were great, fast and helpful.
But our stay was made perfect by the concierge staff. What a great people they have there. Every little thing we asked about was handled with smile and professional manners. And the service went beyond that. 
Even if some rooms may be little run down and the walls could be thicker everything was clean and beautiful. 
Location is great, just by Arlington station and so nice to be able to walk every direction to something nice to see.
This was our first time in Boston area, but we will definitely come back soon, and of course we look forward staying that time again at Boston Park Plaza.",1

 We booked two Executive rooms We were given on Executive room the other one was not It was much smaller and had little attention compared to the other room  Concierge was very helpful,0
"Staff at reception didn't seem terribly friendly, but other employees encountered were nice. The rooms are small, but modern, clean, and functional. Air conditioning units are mounted at the window, so if you need it running, it can be too noisy for some. If your room is located to the back, street noise is not an issue. The Wifi is flaky and slowish, but it works. There's a huge load of channels including many HD ones on TV. But the most important thing should be the bed, and that was heavenly. The location hardly could be any better, since the hotel is just -- minutes walk from Penn Station.",0
 Nothing  The staff were very friendly and helpful The room is not big but not small by London standard either It s a little far away from any tube station but a very pleasant walk along the high fashion Sloan Street as long as the weather is not too bad Seems always some taxi waiting at the gate so not a problem at all for those don t plan to use public transportation Walking distance to some of the A list museums ,1

"This is a really fine & very cool hotel, with a special character all of its own. Great location in downtown Chicago. Fantastic value when we stayed there, admittedly having booked about - months in advance. Very friendly, helpful & efficient staff. Lovely design, good modern furniture, great beds. Some really nice & unusual touches : free buffet breakfast on each floor, free afternoon drinks & nibbles every day, selection of good DVD to borrow. Very comfortable rooms, good beds. All in all a seriously pleasant & cool hotel. We would strongly recommend it & will be sure to go back on future trips to chicago.

 Very dusty small and cramped single room Overpriced by any western standards I understand that people will always book a room in Bloomsbury for what APPEARS to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere The name and the photos of the ad are really misleading I can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but I really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped  General niceness of stuff although one had the impression these days it s more important to be fluent in Russian than in English at London s hotels lobbies The bathroom was surprisingly ok and clean although small and with very low quality towels ,0
 Extremely dirty There were roaches in my room The room was on the first floor But there was no direct lift to that side of the floor So I had to take a lift to the 2nd floor then walk a long hallway take another lift and go to the first floor and then walk I had lot of baggage and a kid and no one in the hotel helped me In adequate staffing  The only thing I liked in this hotel were the restaurant staff They were polite and helpful,0
No Negative The staff was super friendly and always wanted to help out For example when booking tickets to the football or when just asking for directions ,1
 wifi was down for most of my stay breakfast was ok but I expected something a bit better better coffee more choice better cooked products  comfortable bed helpful staff ,1
 There wasn t anything I didn t like  The hotel was fantastic For only being open a few months there wasn t the usual hiccups you would find Everything ran smoothly Service was exceptional ,1
No Negative Perfect hotel for those who appreciate the spirit of real France Staff receives you like at home Thank you Definitely will come back ,1
 The hotel was renovating and our room was on the exact floor the building activity was going on within 20m there was a lot of noise drilling hacking and there was a smell of an open sewer in the hallway The room was small the view was poor on a small soil littered roof When booking a good deal one does not expect to enter a building site  The location is excellent around the corner of Place Vendome within walking distance of Galeries Lafayette The bed was good bathroom small but clean the breakfast was fine The staff was good and courteous ,0
 There s no hot water served inside the room you have to go out to the pantry for a cup of tea it s really not convenient  i like the bed only it s comfortable ,0
 1 It doesnt have a long mirror or a mirror in the room Only a short mirror in the bathroom 2 Blankets are very poor and look quite flimsy and feel a bit itchy 3 Room is very dark  Location,0
"Stayed - nights there, in the middle of remodle, paint not finished on the wall, Carpet was dirty, sink drain stopped up, needless to say a good night's sleep was expected, oh no the room above us had traffic all night, when i inquired at the desk, i understand a questionable young lady had been with severa visitors.....I have stayed here for years.
I was expecting a refund for at least one night, the GM Sam Lucus advised he would give $--. I expressed the sign at the front desk, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""satisfaction guarantee"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" this must be for the folks who visited room --- or for the GM> I will never stay there again.",0
 We had a very bad smell is one of the 2 rooms The staff was very reactive to clean but despite their efforts the odour remainded and we had to live with it as windows can t be opened The room service portion size are ridiculously small Being at the 4th floor we had a view on a petrol station and a ugly roof  The staff cares a lot about the guest and is very friendly The breakfast as well as the hotel restaurants are fantastic The hotel is well located not far from the center and on a nice area the rooms are very larged and well equiped ,1

 There was occasionally some noise outside our windows  we really enjoyed the location of the hotel it was within a few steps of the metro station that leads to all the major areas in milan The staff were super helpful and informative to all of our requests and we felt that our early check out at 3 am went very smoothly because of the staff there The breakfast was very nice ,1
 The staff one guy was rude Also during the check out from 12 till 1pm they have called me 2 times asking me to leave even though i asked for some minutes to come down They tried to charge me 10 euros for checking out 1 hour late I think they are not professional Also it is hard to find a taxi in front of the hotel  Location,0

 Poor service overhaul at check in I requested help with my luggages I was told to go to my room and the luggage would follow but 30 mins later nothing I called but nothing happen so I had to go back to pick up my own luggage I was never helped very corporate environment the reception doesn t t make you feel welcome it rather feels like the reception of a hospital room service food was disgusting I ordered the burger the fish chips the mushroom soup and Mc Donald food is much better  Location is good close to central station ,0
No Negative Helpful reception staff good breakfast,0
 We did not experience a single problem  Fantastic staff Amazing location Really nice rooms Perfect hotel at a great price ,1
 I didn t like how the bed was actually two beds next to each other They kept moving apart and was just weird Also housekeeping left random things in the hallway like packs of toilet paper and there were two mugs sitting on a stand throughout our entire stay no they weren t decoration  We loved the location and were able to walk to everything Also the rooms were very nice and clean I think we had an urban room ,1
 There is no aircon in the roomNo Positive,1
 Extremely slow check in staff pleasant but incompetent Allocation of unsuitable room last available apparently but not sufficiently pre advised to book elsewhere Incredibly noisy due to lack of adequate glazing on 3rd floor leading to sleepless night  Nothing,0

 No windows or air conditioningNo Positive,0
Very clean room & bathroom. Great front desk staff. Breakfast was fine and the free dinners weren't that bad. We saved tons by eating breakfast & dinner at the hotel.,1
 It is a tired hotel which was expensive compared to others we have stayed in very dark quite depressing interiors with terrible bedroom lighting and not many pictures etc to make a very large room comfortable My daughters bedroom was so small she could barely put her suitcase anywhere we didnt feel that we wanted to hang around there so spent as little time as possible which is a shame because it was expensive the position in Amsterdam is excellent,0
 We had difficulty understanding the girl at reception who checked us in she had a really strong accent and spoke very quickly after asking her to repeat herself several times we walked away with only 50 of the information she d told us  How close it is located to London Tower and the cleanliness of the hotel everything was sparkling ,1
No Negative All it was fine but for me that most important it was human relations let me take this opportunity to express my special thanks go to the all staff ,1
No Negative Very helpful front desk Great location metro station close by Very good breakfast ,1
 It didn t look much like the photos that were shown on its site The staircase to the bed was very narrow and steep and the ceiling above the bed was so low that I couldn t stand up without hitting my head and I am only 6 tall  The staff were friendly and polite and the TV worked ,0

No Negative Loved every second I spent there ,1
"This is a pretty property--a typically unimaginative Marriott built around historic buildings and a garden--but try as they might, they can't get anything right when it comes to service. No coffee with my coffee maker. I called and asked that some be left outside my door while I showered. I got loud banging on the door by the security and decaf. The restaurant service is the slowest going. No one knows where groups are meeting amid the confusing warren of meeting rooms. Everyone was nice enough this time (see my previous reviews--that hasn't always been the case), but a lot of training is needed of the whole staff. As I've written on other stays here, if you are choosing your own hotel, rather than being placed here by your business as I am, there are better choices in the area.",0
 An alarm went off in the middle of the night and we had no explanation as to why and the recpeionist was very rushed not his fault be we felt rushed too  I liked the decor and the location alot The bed was amazing so soft Also appreciated the air conditioning,1
 The room was very small and a random person entered our room while we were in there saying he usually needs to check the bed for confort I don t believe he knew we were in the room Hotel staff wasn t able to answer who that person was  The location is excellent and many attractions are located within walking distance St Paul s tube station is also nearby ,0
 The hotel lost its charm Bad staff noisy small room overpriced Could hear other guests sneeze and talk from room Very inconvenient and not how it was a few years ago I would not recommend this hotel  Location ,0

 Room was tiny and dull Dark brown was ugly and depressing Furnitures cheaplooking Soundproof doesnt work voices from street and corridors was disturbing And really disappointing was the restaurant where we eat once The food was good but the place was so tiny and ugly So this is not 4 star but only 3 star hotel  The cleanest place ever The bed and pillows best ever in hotels where I have tried to sleep Lounge and lobbies was beautiful ,0
No Negative Rooms claustrophobic too small,0

 Pictures did not match room Room was too small to be nice Room was not professionally cleanNo Positive,0
"This hotel was perfect for the location and security we needed due to gated parking lot and overnight security. We were on motorcycles and were able to park right in front of our rooms. The dissappointing part of our stay was the bathrooms!! Oh my! There was mold and mildew. The tub had rust. The toilet looked very old. The towels were dingy and needed replacing. I had also requested queen size beds and told the reservation was booked for full size beds. The manager finally agreed to straighten this out. With what this hotel offers, i would hope an investment would be made to upgrade the bathrooms which is badly needed. I like the fact that sinks are located outside of bathroom for easy access. Although convenient, this hotel is not up to Courtyard Marriott standards in its current state.",0
No Negative Good rooms excellent location Super buzz around the bar all evening ,1
Pro- good location. 2 connected appartment so has 2 kitchen/ living room. 3 bedroom/3 bath. Good/quick communication and responsive.<br/><br/>Cons- strong odor in master bedroom/bathroom of the 2 bedroom/bath appt. Dirty towels and mold/leaking ceiling.,0

 Our room was at the front side of the hotel it was very noisy in the night because of the strong traffic There is no balcony at this side of the hotel A lot of renovation would be needed at some place At the breakfast we couldn t find free place to sit  The location is good 15 min walk from the city and very close to the beach The breakfast is very rich the swimming pool is nice at the top of the hotel ,0

"I stayed there for three days on business and whilst the staff were helpful and mostly friendly I found the general atmosphere opressive and gloomy, from the black scuffed floorboards to the brown fur skins on the lobby wall. There was a perpetual smoker on my floor and so it smelt of cigarette smoke and my window looked out onto the kitchen extractor shaft. They kindly swapped my first room to another, but it had the same problem! The Japanese restaurant was excellent for lunch and Whole Foods is just over the road if you are craving something fresh and wholesome to eat for breakfast, rather than more waffles or pancakes. It's location is great and the rooms were clean with nice shampoo! Only other thing was that the iPod dock made my iPod crash and the wi-fi wasn't free. Don't think I would stay here again.",0
 A little bit far out but transport links great Bed not very comfy  Staff very friendly and helpful,1
 The breakfast was a real let down woke up expecting something like a good English breakfast but was met with cold scrambled eggs no bacon or sausages and part toasted toast Back to the room for a shower and found the shower to hardly work at all which was a shame as it looks like it might be a nice power shower  The rooms were very nice clean and comfy and the hotel was situated perfectly for us to tour round London ,0

 Sofa bed could have been more comfortable Inhouse restaurant Carluccio,1
 Room was too hot Location is perfect,1
We stayed two nights May ---. The hotel was decent. The room was extremely small and looked out on a center lot full of trash receptacles and debris. The walls that our room looked out on were loaded with grafitti. The distance to the monuments-museums required cab - bus rides. The indoor pool was small but nice. The breakfast was decent but the eggs were horrible. Parking was exorbitantly high but we managed to get a package that included parking. All in all I'd say it was decent. I would consider staying again if I could get the parking-room package for under two hundred.,0
No Negative Did not have breakfast,0

 Wifi is too weak some of the room cannot connected The staff are nice and helpful,0
 We booked two rooms with one for 3 people The rooms were only set up for two and we had to ask both for the additional bedding and towels separately I would have expected this to have been in place since it was clear from the booking This is a minor gripe which was very quickly remedied without question on request  Great location with excellent rooms and breakfast ,1
 complimentary water not provided daily when cleaning as promised though we remind them in the morning lack of space on the room comparing to price and star rates  toilet with hose modern decoration easy access to wifi,1
 This was the worst hotel I stayed since my student days The room was tiny but more importantly in a terrible condition The bedding smelled and I had spread my clothes over the bed to be able to sleep The walls were covered with marks the carpet dirty It took me nearly half an hour to check in even though there was only one or two people ahead of me There is no way this is a 4 star hotel I would seriously question whether it would be classified as a 3 star either Very disappointing No Positive,0

From the second we arrived to the second we left - everything was perfect. Special mention to Betty the best concierge in the world. Each and every member of staff we came in contact with went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional. This is my No - hotel in Boston.,1
 The room I was in was in a second building set a street behind the main building this should have been made clear at point of booking the room was then up 3 flights of very steep stairs which were difficult to negotiate with luggage in the morning when leaving  The overall quality was brilliant the staff were friendly and accommodating and the room was clean and well presented ,0

"The location in Seattle's South Lake Union area is good, easy to get downtown, several Lake front restaurants walkable, and close to some major medical facilities which is why we were here. The rooms have good cooking facilities and are spacious for longer stays. We needed a place that would let us bring our dog, and this Residence Inn allows pets, and doesn't make a huge deal about it. There is a $-- per night surcharge and a few common sense rules for bringing your pet. Parking is $-- per night which is a little steep, since the neighboring Silver Cloud has free parking. For us the pet friendly policy trumped the parking charge. Hotel has a more than adequate free breakfast buffet, and daily newspaper delivered to room for Marriott rewards members. Free wi-fi too.",1
"Wouldn't stay here again. We had a harbor view room, the view was great, but the room was incredibly noisy and also incredibly small. Sink in the room, nothing terribly impressive about the room, although the bed was comfy. Carpet was stained, bathroom nothing special. Not surprisingly, the rooms look much better on their web-site. The staff was helpful, the continental breakfast a nice touch, but that is about it! If you like the location the Harbor Court Hotel is next door.",0

 The air conditioning emitted a screeching noise that prevented me sleeping so had to turn the air off this was during a very hot spell which also meant I didn t sleep I had to work the next day so I was really unhappy about that The kitchen closes totally at 10 p m so no room service nothing not even a sandwich The hotel is remote I needed cash but there were no ATMs close by Luckily taxis take credit cards No Positive,0

"We stayed here in July before an Alaskan cruise. The location is ideal for this as the pier used by Celebrity is literally next door. It was delightful to just walk the suitcases over to board the ship. Also an easy walk to PikePlace Market and the associated restaurants. The hotel was a bit worn, at least in the rooms, but the rustic decor makes it seem intentional. However, everything was comfortable, the people friendly and the views wonderful. Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The Marriott was also near the dock, but the Edgewater was much better situated and a better value.",1
 Many rooms are noisey because of the tram and the shower area is too tight The lactation is central and the rooms are clean and comfortable ,1
 Room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break Great Location We stayed here for the Notting Hill Carnival which was walking distance Very close to the tube Staff were all very helpful Let us leave our bags in the luggage room come back to get things out of them later Staff couldn t do enough Nice clean bathroom ,1

 Size of the room The location and stuff,1
No Negative The place was so clean and perfect the rooms look so great,1
 Honestly I was so bothered with the TV as not a single English Channel for movies This hotel receives guests from all over the world so a couple of English channels for movies and shows would have made a big difference  I liked the location as we arrived to Gard Du Nord and was typically right in front of the station No hassle Also so many convenient restaurants and coffee shops around ,1
 Could hear people next doorNo Positive,1
"The staff was useless and unfriendly! Our room smelt like cigarettes, musk, and moth ball. Towels are ratty and stingy plus a dirty bathroom. Oh not to forget no one informed us the $-- per day parking until we checked out! There are also many homeless people sleeping outside the building, no frig, no microwave, no coffee maker, and no they WILL NOT heat anything up for you! Therefore bring lots of money to eat out! Management was there for decor! How they got a -star rating is a mystery!",0
 The bed was not very comfortable and the room service needs improvement Bathroom needs to be improved The staff is amazing and there is an old Parisian charm to this hotel My room reminded me of a Parisian Apartment and was very quiet The location is excellent,1

"I really enjoyed staying at this Embassy Suites. It's a much more modern version of their typical hotel and very clean. The complimentary breakfast was awesome and even included an omelet bar... definitely not your typical free breakfast. Also, take advantage of the free happy hour. Walking distance to the baseball stadium. We took advantage of the pedicabs as well. Hope you are lucky enough to get Andy Smith, the was great!",1
 Poor gym no food facilities at night Really just very ordinary Overpriced Really only 3 sstar Good rooms nice linen clean,0

"The hotel has a good location on Sunset boulevard. The Hollywood boulevard with the walk of fame is just a short walk away. Rooms are clean, but quite tiny. The location seemed to be more or less safe even at night. Breakfast was OK in American standards.",0
 Staff is not helpful No car park offer and slowest reseption ever Its our 3rd stay there and Always had a problem with booking reservations i think they are not well trained for the job Also car park shouldnt be that complicated  Hotel tech is superb and also size of the room is quite good,0
No Negative Excellent staff solved a room problem promptly and very courteously Comfy stylish room Great location ,1
 I did not feel as welcomed by the staff as in other hotels I had stayed at The room and the bathroom were TINY I had to stand back to be able to shave because the wash basin area was too tight to maneuver so was the shower The window in the room opened up to the middle of the building so there was zero view I should have booked the Urban Room but for the price I paid for the Superior it was definitely not worth it  The only good thing about this hotel was the location right across from the main train station and at the beginning of the Damrak means that you are well connected to everything ,0
 Room was spacious but poorly furnished and laid out Great location and very helpful,1

 The rooms were really small and what they said was a garden view overlooked a roof with potted plants below For the money you can find a better place I tried to change rooms but the girl told me she would have to ask her boss the next day We were too busy to move the next day  The place was a great location,0
 The only thing that was not excellent was the hotel breakfast We had to send it back as the first time it arrived it was cold However the staff were happy to return it to the kitchen and bring it back hot They were very apologetic I did think it was quite expensive at 21 50 though  The bed was definitely the most comfortable I have ever stayed in The hotel room was lovely with a great shower and quality toiletries The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly As it was my partners birthday they also put balloons and a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine in our room which was a lovely touch ,1
 Uncomfortable foam pillows pretty ordinary breakfast bad coffee no extra little comforts in the room not even a branded pen and notepad tatty old bathroom when did you last see a plug and chain in a four star hotel The standard of accommodation in this place doesn t even come close to the image it markets once you ve left the downstairs lounge and bar areas I d seriously consider staying somewhere else if you want a nice room for your money  Helpful staff,0
 Absolutely nothing It was sensational  The location cannot be beaten The amenities were great The room we had a canal view room was amazing The staff could not be more helpful We even left a valuable item in the room safe by mistake and one phone call to the hotel and they had found the item and posted it back to us in Australia You can t get better service than that,1

 Hotel only opened Still construction site Kitchen and laundry facilities not availabel Great decor ,0
 Small dirty rooms To open the wc door must jump in the shower No space to move in the rooms Worst breakfast ever to have eggs and bacon and can Beens must pay extra The stuff is friendly enough but that s not enough for a hotel to work It s too expensive with no facilities Not even a bottle of water in the empty mini bar Not even a bath robe While sleeping you can hear what s happening to all the other rooms  The location is ok,0

 Single room very cramped and VERY dated Friendliness of the staff good breakfast,0
 Room was nasty and on two levels had to walk up stairs to go to bathroom Way over priced  Staff was nice ,0
Location is very good. The wall to wall carpets are smelly. The Lobby has nothing left of the grandeur it probably had in the ----ies We ordered i King Size room but got a room with a Queen size bed. IThe room was absurdly small. We are to short skinny guys and WE could hardley get round the bed. The AC is smelly and outside there is a fan on top of the lobby wich makes you think you are sleeping beside a vacuum cleaner. Bathroom was nice though. But maybe that is what you get for USD --- a night on Manhattan...,0
"Typical classic NY hotel..small and old rooms but well cleaned and maintained. Great location, Central park just behind one corner, Times square behind the second one. At least - close subway stations and one just under the hotel. Very important to point the concierge service.. they will send you just to any kind of bar-pub-club you wish.",0

 There s a little mouse in the room The corridor is very narrow Lift is old and slow there is only 1 lift The room next to me close the door loudly The noise comes in my room very easy My room is 318 on the 3 rd floor If I don t want to use lift I have to use a very narrow stairs I saw the other customer talk to the manager of the hotel that there is someone go into her room Very creepy but I don t know it s true or not but I think it s possible because the only security is the keycard that can enter to your room  There are 3 sets of utensils in the room everyday ,0

 I was charged 60 euros extra because i was told this is imposed by Government It was no where mentioned in the booking I was in rush to catch my flight for which I could not argue much There are not many attractions nearby the hotel itself  We went to Milan for the expo and got this hotel Staff was very helpful and there was a tram nearby Breakfast was very nice especially the fresh baked croissants and coffee ,0

"In April my husband and i stayed at the Bedford Hotel. Its is in a great position but our room was hot and very noisy.
The air conditioning unit could not be adjusted from each individual room and we had to keep the window open at night. It was noisy of course and we were unfortunate that we didnt know they were working on the building across the road.The Jackhammer started about -pm in the afternoon and went to -pm at night. They obviously have no laws re this in Nyc
Otherwise this would have been a good spot close to Grand Central and walking distance to Times Square.",0
"Arrived late on December --th and was greeted kindly and hospitably by older women in very nice office,,,,Went to the room to settle in an found bathroom cabinets all wood rotted and fixtures corroded. Mattresses had a coating of dirt. We slept on top of the bed and left abruptly in the morning without even showering. It was shocking. The smoke detectors didn't work either. No coffee pot or hair dryer as promised. Terrible experience...",0
"Everything was the best, you would not regret if you chose this room",1
 Shower not working Metal springs coming through mattress heating not working windows blowing in a draft keys not working on third day after we moved rooms This is not a 4 star hotel and shouldn t be advertised as such On our first two nights we didn t sleep due to the issues mentioned above we then moved rooms and the card key didn t work on return to the room  staff were friendly and helpful Good location ,0

"First face of the hotel is the valet team: Gentlemen all, welcoming, helpful, efficient and courteous.
Second team is reception: smiling, gracious, patient, professional and pleasant.
Rooms (I have been in many) are comfortable and non-commercial. Internet is fast and free - one can save $---to-$-- a night in that alone!
Location is excellent for central Denver. Close to parks, museums, public transport, walking distance to professional sporting facilities, multiple good restaurants near by.
I usually visit for reasons of business but have brought family and friends all of whom enjoy the experience.",1

Bed covers seemed intensely stained with a brown coffee looking substance. after inspecting - rooms I found one on the --th floor that didn't have the mold issue, but, was directly across from a very loud ice machine.
Basically uninhabitable, though very cheap. Wonder why... Will never stay here again and would not recommend it.",0
 The bed wasn t especially comfortable and the high tech lighting was too complicated for me to understand Same with the heating and cooling We never did figure out the television For the cost of one night I was hoping for a bit more actual luxury and not just the appearances of it The staff made you feel like a star but the actual accomodations were a bit wanting for star quality  The rooms was spacious and it was a King sized bed very hard to find in the UK It was very clean and we had a view of the courtyard The staff were extremely friendly and accomodating The location is awesome just blocks from the Parliament buildings and Westminster Abbey ,0
No Negative Great location Reasonable price for London ,1

 The shower is very weak making it difficult to wash hair I had to get a jug from the bar The lady behind the bar told us it was because everyone else was using the water at the same time I showered at different times throughout our 4 night stay and there was no difference There was also no light bulb in one of the bedside lamps Noisey as the hotel is on the main road and beside the trainline  Great location and fairly clean Hotel is a little run down but for this price in Greenwich it was expected Breakfast was basic continental however hot breakfast could be ordered with an additional fee ,0
No Negative The location is fantastic within walking distance to Oxford Street Covent Garden Soho etc It is not a luxurious hotel but it is cosy clean comfortable and well decorated The only downside is that it does not have an elevator it only has three floors though so you will not die Rooms are on the small side but I would not expect anything else in that location Price quality ratio is very good for London ,1

 When we arrived at 21 20 when asked if the kitchen was still open the staffed advised that it was closed hearing that we decided to use the pool facilities we then went out to look for something to eat we got back tk the hotel around 23 00 we then asked one of the bar staff what time the kitchen was closed as we saw other customers still eating in the dining area we where told 22 30 if this information was known by the staff on the front desk we wouldn t have to travel outside the hotel to find food as we had travelled for 4hrs to get there and was very tired this was very disappointing  I liked the hotel has 24hr access I also liked that it has pool sauna facilities,0
 The carpet was pretty grubby and didn t look as if it had been cleaned in a while The room was located next to a wooded area and the windows had been left open so there were lots of insects flying around the room and on the bed which was horrid There was a party going on until the early hours which was really very noisy so could not get to sleep for ages  The bed was pretty comfortable and breakfast was nice enough,0

 We booked a double room and got given 2 single beds pushed together View out of the window was peoples back gardens and most nights they were having parties and were loud so it was hard to sleep The room was tiny and looked nothing like it did on the internet no where near as modern We stayed for 5 days 4 nights and the whole time we never had hot water in the shower except for on the last day Got told a lot of misleading information and it wasn t in a very nice area Definitely not worth the money  Nothing,0
 Water in bathroom can t stay in a normal temperature Either is cold or hot hot And if you have the luck to wake up 4 in the morning to catch your flight you have to wait for 20 minutes for the water to cool down unless you use it for a cup of tea long way to the center 20 30 min with the bus metro need to walk 20 min and if it s night it s a bit scary as its empty streets breakfast was not included 16 extra pp bus stop right outside the hotel until 11pm after that is either the metro until 2 00am or taxi walking distance to the beach very quiet tea coffee utilities reception 24 7,0

"Stayed here on business with a group, - rooms in total for - nights, room was neat and clean, a little dated, had stayed here years ago and seems like it has gone through some updates. - problem with this hotel is the AC system and mold, -st room had an overwhelming mold smell, asked to be changed, no problem. They keep the AC on meat locker setting so when you turn down the ac to say -- degrees, you begin to get an odor. Staff was nice, they gave us a ride to a local steakhouse in their van then came and picked us up afterward. Decent little bar in the lobby for a drink after work, I would stay here again for under $--.--",0

 The wifi is extremely terrible The room is very clean,0
 The hotel is very run down and definitely not a 4 star property The room was very small Bathroom tiles were very badly cracked toilet roll holder hanging off the wall shower head that kept slipping down the pole so you had to hold it while in the shower Bath was dirty towels with holes in Staff miserable Unpleasant smell in reception On a positive note it s very centrals and we only went there to sleep so it was bearable Disappointing since I booked this for my husbands 50th No Positive,0

 The staff could have been a little more ethical while treating their clients and the AC of the room i was in didn t work the staff refused to change my room till i didn t pack my bags and come down to the concierge at 2am  only the fact that it had a good location ,0
 Asked for quiet room Although inside hotel was reasonably quiet didn t expect to hear staff from Hilton laughing talking outside of our bedroom window 15 huge bins being emptied every morning before 7am However in saying this it would not put me off returning It was a nice clean room for the night No Positive,1

 Load of scaffolding outside the bedroom window Room very small Long queue for breakfast Location was just right,0
 Everything else was from bad to strictly ok Breakfast was pathetic stale and wrongly described Staff was largely mid leading Some might have been trying to be helpful but completely contrasting information by others Booking com s lowest score for a review is 2 5 which is highly misleading  The location ,0
 We were placed in a really dodgey renovated room The floor was damaged and uneven the surfaces in the shower were poorly cared for and the shower didn t operate well The water in the basin was hotter than the shower The worst thing was the light There was no window covering to prevent spotlights on all night from the courtyard shining into the room We got very little sleep Other rooms in the hotel are probably ok Ours wasn t  The staff were amazing and helpful Couldn t have asked for more of them Always cheerful The location is excellent and our reason for booking this hotel ,0

"I am writing this from room ---- in the Four Seasons. The sun is rising over the lake and streaming through the window. The view is spectacular. I've stayed in many hotels in Chicago, but avoided the Four Seasons due to cost. After much disappointment elsewhere, I elected to try it and see.
Stay here; it is worth every penny you will pay. The service is wonderful, the staff can not do enough, and the food is better than the rooms. And the rooms are great.
I don't think I'll see staying elsewhere in the future unless the market crashes even more. This is the best hotel in the Windy City.",1
 Everything Price No air con Tired small outdated room Staff Rubbish stored outside our window Terrible for Hilton brand wont be back,0
"I have stayed here a number of times and this time I brought my granddaughter. When the luggage was brought to the room the young man said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hi Tiara"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as he had been told her name. The look on her face was worth a million. There is no hotel that I have stayed at where the staff are more attentive, yet low key. They are genuinely friendly and make you feel like you belong. I am far from wealthy but this hotel is worth the extra expense. The location is superb, room service is top notch and the Bristol is a relaxed dining room where you can dress casual and eat from a great menu.",1
 The shower was a joke we are not big people by any stretch of the imagination but you could hardly bend down to wash your feet There were no drawers to put socks etc in and the bedside table was 9 inch squareNo Positive,0

"we stayed here - nights on a high floor at the back,whilst the view was not much it was quiet.
Staff were helpfull especially the concierge who found us a van ride to the airport and took care of our luggage.
The hotel is in the theatre district and near enough to all main locations so you can walk.
having read the reviews of this hotel before iwe went we wonder if we were at the same hotel.",0

"We recently got back from a weekend at the Marriott on the Magnificient Mile in Chicago. I got an awesome rate of $-- through Travelzoo! I believe it is usually over $--- a night. When we walked in my husband said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""are you sure you got this for $-- a night?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" It was beautiful! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge gave wonderful advise and directions. No question was too small. The location was perfect--right on Michigan Ave. near all the shopping. The rooms are nice, although not big, but we weren't there much anyway. The beds were very comfortable. I'd stay at the Marriott for this great rate again in a minute.",1
 Smelly rooms heating system that made noises and didn t let us sleep the whole night Noisy with disturbance from room above us all the 4 nights we stayed there Definitely not value for money Very friendly and helpful staff who were always willing to help and advise on where to visit Location of the property is very convenient and strategically located in the city centre across the Amsterdam Centraal station ,0
 The sheets are brown and it looks like they re moldy And the sheets are very uncomfortable Not good quality cotton Breakfast is like a battlefield Rooms are quite small and not very clean You get what you pay for No Positive,0
 The room had no air conditioning and the windows don t open and the heat was well in the 20c all night building work a few yards off the building so the windows are dirty staff very good  Room clean location first class breakfast good for the price,1
 It was quite noisey at night but was expected Rooms also got very hot at night which made it uncomfortable to sleep  Location Staff very friendly and helpful Very Clean Great breakfast and bar ,1
 When we arrived we was given our room which was the smallest double room I ve ever seen there was a draft coming from the window and for 342 I thought was outrageous After I complained we was moved to what was suppose to be a bigger room but wasn t bigger by much and it was the same again a draft from the window No Positive,0
 Nothing  Very spacious rooms Modern contemporary styling Attractive comfortable public areas all dressed for Christmas Excellent restaurant Breakfast especially something to look forward to at the start of the day Easy access into the city via the U bahn We had a very enjoyable stay look forward to staying again when we next visit Vienna which we loved too ,1

 Sunday bar staff very miserable no please or thank you very rude Service location plus very clean ,1
 Nothing to dislike Location is very central and close to important touristic places on foot Plenty of bars supermarkets shops around ,1
 Nothing Thank you for asking a survey I do not think its a 4 star hotel regarding its services I already made complaints about room 210 for air conditioning fault and room no 206 for the room fridge which remained out of order and no body came to fix it For room no 210 when we made complaint of AC fault and foul smell first the staff gave us a n air freshner Strangely and then they changed our room to sixth floor 602 where internet signals were very poor ,0
 There is limit for using wifi It s not so convenience for us For example we have two computers and two cell phone The limit is up to 3 units It means that there is one facility have to got out of wifi  The breakfast is good ,0
 Everything was good  Fabulous artworks all around Comfortable and whacky all at the same time ,1
 No breakfast included in already high price Probably overpriced,0
 Seems that the rooms were designed to be twitted about but they left out some basics like a bathroom door that actually closes or an ability to open a window and let fresh air in Also they re very very small  Room control via iPad is cool international power outlets is a nice touch High quality breakfast and located right on a tube station ,1
 One particular member of staff at reception was really not helpful at all when asking about stations She told me to get a taxi and completely ignored my initial question Our initial room had faeces on the toilet seat and back cover The sink was also overplugged We managed to change rooms One member of staff who changed our room when we told her about the faeces on the bak seat of the toilet and our sink being overplugged,0
 The room was very small The cleaning was very bad The beds were badly made the towels ware not changed very bad experience Wouldn t stay there again  Location,0
 CHARGING FOR WIFI USB OUTRAGIOUS  Food at Min King and view of park from bedroom window,0
 the sink plug wouldnt open so sink was full of dirtyy water whole timeNo Positive,0
 D cor is incredibly old they are not investing in any type of renovations Very basic channels offered on TV don t know why but really slow to load a channel Don t recommend to take the breakfast option it s very expensive considering what they offer Wifi in the lobby area is free but only for 30 minutes In the rooms you get 20 minutes per day and if you buy a voucher it s 7 pounds per day and only works for one device Overall I won t come back again in my next visit to London For sure there are better options than the Britannia with a better price  Staff was nice room was relatively clean location to my office was good Tried the Indian restaurant and it was very good ,0
"This hotel is in desperate need of renovation. Stayed here the night before a flight and am a Marriot silver elite customer. Horrible customer service at check-in. Had requested a king and when it wasn't available would only be given an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""upgraded room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with a king at an additional charge. Totally unnecessary for the add'l charge especially as often as we stay at a Marriott. The room itself was on the top floor and was supposedly an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""upgrade"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", but was very dingy. Carpets need to be replaced - had a musty odor. Bathrooms are old and very outdated. Would not stay here again. Will try the Westin next time on the same street. Went there for dinner at the Daily Grill.",0
 The hotel indoor is really outdated the rooms are ugly and the gym is just a small room with a couple of training machine The worst thing is the annoying and unpolite behaviour of the staffNo Positive,0
 The room was no bigger than my laundry I am 5 2 and slim build and I had to turn sideways to fit between the desk and bedside table There was no where to put my case to easily access its contents I had to leave the bathroom door open so I had enough room to dry off after showering Very poor value for money Would not stay there again The room was so small I am surprised it meets regulation standards  Location and cleanliness,0
 I noticed the first few days that the person coming into my room to clean was eating some of my food He or she also had their hands on my handbag That bothered me so I had to let the housekeeping know about it  Location wise the hotel was very convinent Also the staff were very friendly and welcoming The price was good as well ,1
 The room needed a refurbishment It was worn down and did not reflect the price level for the stay even for London Facilities were fine,0
"Ok, I stayed here over a weekend and all I can say is...terrible location. 
Good points:
lobby is very nice and the renovated rooms are nice
The staff was pretty nice 
Bad:
terrible location - near a shopping center which was basically closed and the mall way across is supposed to be dangerous. Basically, there wasn't any where to eat except for the hotel
the Starbucks in the hotel closed at noon on a Sat so it was even tough getting coffee.
there was some weird meetings going on that weekend
a very loud wedding was going on so it was tough sitting in the lobby at night
the pool was nice but there was a smell of gas",0
 It was quite dated and check in took an age The price and conveniance,0
 Wifi bad connection breakfast disorganized good location Staff friendly,0

 Nothing  Good location Very friendly staff ,1
 They issued a pre authorization for the entire stay Single double room was too small Poor continental breakfast selection but good quality If you stay more than one night then you have to eat the same things The room was super small and expensive Good for one night stay The hotel is clean,0
 Wish all the stuff be like the lady who gives me advice to leave early at Barcelona match to find a taxi and she fixed the safety box for us and she was in the reception in the day I left in 20 8 At almost 8 am thanks a lot and I wish that all the stuff not be the one in the reception who I told him that the air conditioning is not working and he tell you must wait for tomorrow and that was before the match of Barcelona and sevilla It s comfy but without covering for the children,0
 If was located north of the river would be perfect The staff were the best ,1
 Slightly long walk to metro stations  Large and clean room Comfortable mattress ,1
 More space stairs less steeper  Bistrot downstair for lunch and breakfast was very nice and we could get nice food The room was small but everything we needed was available I appreciated the NEspresso coffee machine with capsules available ,1
 It would have been great if they d had a nice roof terrace The space is there but it has no tables and chairs to sit and relax  The location was away from the tourist areas so nice and quiet but also very easy to get to the Ramblas The bed was huge and super comfortable Free tea and coffee in reception was great too ,1
 There is a dancing or music school right next to my room with an incredible noise until 7 30 pm which was not nice The young lady at the reception was not able to provide me with written in voice in the name of my company and albeit being really friendly she asked my to spell the words Munich and Germany and she was also unable to spell the name of my company which is a very simple English animal s name not any more difficult than cat or dog  The bathroom was very good but for this price one would have expected a little bit more even in difficult London ,0
 We requested a double bed and again they asked on check in but we had two single beds pushed together which was annoying Plus the room was very warm despite the air con The sky bar was closed on arrival and also before we checked out would of liked to have seen the view  The room decor was very nice,1
 Never had a room of the size of a locker before No Positive,0

 Hotel being renovated so could hear works as to be expected  Great location good service at bar and reception ,1

 Price but it is central London so to be expected Great location for our two days in Hyde Park clean and comfortable,1
 The bed was a little hard  Clean and highly efficiently run hotel Good parking available ,1
 Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day  Staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck ,1
 24 7 hospital ambulances driving breakfast organizing very poor location,0

 The dark hallway do not give a good feel as one walks to the room Like going to a cinema at night  The bed was certainly a plus to soothe the the body from a tiring day Real comfy even the sound of tram outside seems so far away We had lunch at the Japanese fusion restaurant and love the Salmon and the Unagi Bento set It is pretty authentic considering it is in Europe ,1
 Asked for poached eggs they took some time to come my husband had eaten his breakfast by then The eggs when they arrived were almost boiled eggs rather than the poached disappointed especially with the 42 00 I payed  The whole experience it was a special treat for my fortieth wedding anniversary ,1

 For 200 a night thought the room was a bit basic Couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink Thought the bed wasnt the best Squeaked every time you moved The building was grand and staff was so friendly and helpful The breakfast was good and location The building looked very grand Liked the extra touches eg petals on the bed ,0
 Some staff were inexperienced and made big mistakes There were two versions of the dinner menu which confused everyone Breakfast was good but very very expensive The rest of the menu and drinks also highly priced but with the location you have no alternative except travelling into the City Room TV s were old and remote controls broken in 2 of 3 rooms I booked  The hotel was clean and the rooms well looked after Staff were mostly very helpful Rooms were modern well sized and with quality fittings ,0
 Check in took a little bit longer than we hoped which may have been due to the timing of our arrival which was several hours late because of train delays  Streamlined modern design made this a fun and relaxing stay The beds were super comfortable due to the linen choice assortment of pillows and mattress Remote controlled room darkening shades were also a hit ,1
 The option of a twin room with extra cost Really comfy bed staff very helpful,1
 No spare pillows and one was not enough Door outside room banged every time someone went through it Had a really bad night s sleep Toiletries very average and whilst location was good you can find much better value for money hotels elsewhere in London  Good location and no road noise,0
No Negative Great location easy access by train metro from airport Breakfast was great ,1
 Everything was perfect  Everything was perfect ,1
 Got room with the window facing fire exit corridor what an unpleasant surprise So no fresh air or daylight for me Also booking says no deposit will be charged wrong the hotel blocked GBP 105 right after I reserved this room online  Breakfast was good rare options such as hummus and salmon are available ,0

No Negative Great location Close to restaurants bars and tourist attractions ,1
 Location was far away from a tube station and getting to the city centre was therefore difficult Staff was extremely nice and friendly ,0
 The Dining Room was shabby and not really big enough The cooked breakfast especially the scrambled egg was not appetising  Nice big room with elegant features Very well located for all attractions in the City Centre Good coffee machine in reception ,1
 The single rooms are far too small to be comfortable despite the nice decor and the room rate was over the top  The staff were exceptional Mariej helped me with IT the ladies at the front desk very helpful and friendly and also the breakfast staff ,1
No Negative After running around all day returning to the hotel was easy and for each day we were in time for happy hour very enjoyable lounge drinks and food plus a big courtyard for those that wanted fresh air The hotel staff was extremely helpful in guiding us to all tourist spots and local restaurants We had dinner in the hotel one evening and it was outstanding Plus a terrific breakfast to start the day Thanks for taking care of us our raves about this beautiful hotel will continue for a long time The photos on the website are very accurate Thanks again ,1

No Negative Clean room great service,1
 There was nothing in particulary that i didnt like  Staff were very friendly the hotel and room were clean and fresh Will definitely go back and encourage a friend to stay over there ,1
 I called the receptionist for slippers after checking into the room and the initial response I got after waiting and calling back was that they are running out of stock and there was break down of delivery service so won t be able to get anything within the next few days I expressed that this sounds ridiculous as an international hotel chain then the receptionist said she would try again and the slippers were delivered afterwards Btw the food quality was poor as a hotel breakfast and that coupled with the service didn t pump me up for a start of the day  Location was good as there s a tram station right outside of the hotel so that it s easy to go to the old town ,0
 Breakfast was better 2 years ago  Everything was great,1
 a little bit farther to station than expect  Room is big clean and newly finished with morden decration The best stay after days of old and small room antique style hotels in Rome and Firenze The staffs are friendly and prepared kindly takeaway breakfast for us early leaving next morning many thanks ,1
 The view of our room wasn t great Little Kitchenette was great 24hrs shops located at the same street free cookies at the lobby Universita metro station is less than 5 minutes away,1
Because this hotel has kitchen units they clearly also have a rodent problem. We were awoken at -am to the sound of a mouse going through one of our bags. Woke up and turned the lights on just in enough time to see him running under the door and out into the hallway. They did comp. Our room for the night but who wants it.,0

"As a Platinum SPG member, I stay at lots of Westin hotels. First time at this Westin. Experience was unremarkable with the exception that this Westin has a club loungethat served a decent breakfast - eggs, juice, toast, muffins, croissants, various cut up fruit, and oatmeal. - free computers and a printer in the lounge was a bonus. For $--- prepaid, this is a good deal. It is right next to LAX with free shuttle so very convenient. Yes, there is airport noise, so if planes landing and taking off are a problem for you, stay somewhere else. It is a busy hotel. It has the normal Heavenly bed and other pleasant furnishings.
Would I stay here again when departing early at LAX? Yes. Would I stay here for any other reason? No.",0

"Awful hotel! Terrible location, not even close to the main part of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""riverwalk"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", though it is near a part of the riverwalk where you could get robbed. Hotel itself is old, almost derelict; front desk answered only half the time when called, and when our old school TV couldn't get the CBS channel from cable, the front desk guy came in, tried to get the channel, and then said: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sorry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and didn't rectify it. There was one other car there on out last night, and I asked what the rate would be, and they quoted a price that was double what I paid per night there. I would never stay here again, and would think twice before staying at any other Super -, it was THAT bad! I came to dispise this hotel greatly.",0
 I used hotel two years ago and it shows signs of deteriorating the walls of the rooms are dirty should be repainted bed had demaged wheels so it was narrow towards the head it wasn t flat There was soap in bathroom from previous attendant with hairs They tried to charged me for garage that I didn t use or reserve Location breakfast,0

 Very small room and very expensive for a fairly average room  Good location in centre of London but very quiet ,0
"Cold welcome at Reception. No smile. No offer of assistance with baggage or directions to room (which was on the Starwood Preferred Guests Floor ).
The first day I had tea but the second day there was tea but no sugar or stirrer ! 
A liitle care to detail would have ensured that there was extra tea and sugar everyday as the coffee was untouched.
The bathroom door didn't shut easily and the clothes hook on the back was missing. Just little things that would've made a difference.",0
 Toilet paper falls directly into toilet bowl Too close when you sit inconvenient to catch paper Internet was not stable No Positive,1

 When very busy on the first morning there were not enough staff for breakfast  The refurbished rooms are excellent Staff are very friendly and welcoming Great hotel to stay,1
 Honestly I can t think of somethings My card kept on getting deactivating but that was more of a personal issue than a staff issue  Bed was very comfy The bathroom was efficient and the brownie served downstairs was very delicious ,1
 It was very far from the city center Normal,0
 The en suite smelt awful from the drains or something and we could not get rid of the smell even when closing the door It was also quite dark in our room and we had to ask for a lamp  Room was very clean and had everything that we needed The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome ,0
 The size of the room difficult to squeeze between the foot of the bed and the wall the noise of doors slamming as fellow guests left their rooms the placement of the glass shelf magnifying mirror and toilet paper holder in the bathroom the designer was surely having a lend having to stand on a chair to access the safe and the inedible and cold bacon and hash browns  Bed was comfortable the window opened so you could get fresh air and the staff in the breakfast room were efficient ,0
 The noice around six in the morning Position very good,0
 Did not understand if there was a temperature regulator somewhere Anyway it was a bit too warm at night  Everything was excellent Room is big looks new excellent location At first a bit intimidating neighbourhood but the hotel is normal is not meant only for couples with nocturnal activities ,1
 Rooms are not only very small but the facilities are not 4 star There is a hot water jug but it is on a small plastic shelf which drips water on the desk below which is the only clear space to leave electrical things Very small amounts of teabags and only plastic glasses and paper cups Location is wonderful and staff were lovely,1

"Just returned from - nights at this hotel, I paid extra for a corner room however not convinced that room ---- was as described however as the room was big enough for our needs I did not query this with reception.
The best thing about this hotel is without a doubt its location - right at the heart of Times Square in the centre of everything, I would stay again but probably wouldnt pay extra for a corner room if room ---- is indeed a corner room",0
"Hotel room was clean, room small but adequate. Great location. Hotel needs to provide larger discount on parking in the garage. Discount was only --%. There was no coffee in the morning on weekends until - a.m., which was ludicrous. Desk staff needs to make a bigger point of telling guests that you need to swipe your roomkey to activate the elevator. Time and again, we got in and other guests did not realize this and couldn't get the elevator to work. Might stay there again as location was very good.",0

"My husband & I stayed here - nights while visiting my son @ SDSU. The room was very small, but a nice roomie bathroom, overall cleanliness was above average. We did not stay in the room at all only to sleep, but the outside was beautiful, people walking and jogging along the marina. Bike and boat rentals were close by. There were a few restaurants along the marina and some with entertainment. I don't think I would stay again just because it was not, what I consider, a desireable area. No shopping close by, but there were some fast food chains and a Denny's for breakfast. If you are vacationing I would choose something close to the downtown, Seaport Village area, but again that is my preference. Our room was $----night and the staff was friendly, allowing us to check in - hours early.",0
 There were some high school kids staying over and they were yelling a lot a singing and jumping so it was horrible notice However we called the reception and they said they will send a security and really in 10 minutes there was no more noise and everything was perfect  Hotel seems like new everything is tide and clean and room was absolutely amazing Internet is extremely good skype and youtube are streaming flawless Location is good for not spoiled tourists takes 15min walk from metro station or if you are by car it is perfect as high way is 3min away and hotel has garage ,1

 SUPER HOT IN THE ROOM While our stay it was 30C in Vienna Our room did not have any conditioners There was only one fan that did not help at all Neither did the windows They were faced to the backyard where restaurant ventpipes are located As a result two nights turned into nightmare It would be also nice to warn guests in advance that breakfast is not included in their booking and they would have to pay additional 17 per person per night in case they want to have hotel breakfast  The lication is super right in the center of the city close to all tourist locations and shops The staff is very friendly always polite and helpful The interior of the hotel is very authentic as if you were in 1920s,1
 Room was tooooo small the bed was bigger than the room it self very claustrophobic  Location was good ,0

"First I'd just like to say the blue-collar staff at this hotel are fantastic. The desk workers, maids, cooks, servers etc really go above and beyond the call of duty. Kudos to them and management for hiring a great bunch.
The interior of the hotel is gorgeous, from the koi ponds to the palm trees to the workout room, everything looks and feels good.
Made to order free breakfast and nightly free happy hour drinks are excellent amenities.
I'm taking one star off because when you pay this much for a hotel, and one that has no problem giving more expensive perks (drinks, breakfast, etc) paying $-- a day to access wireless Internet is silly.
Great location.",1
"I stayed at the Double Tree for business and was unable to function the next day. Unfortunately for guests, certain rooms can not escape the bright lights and noise of Times Square. If you can sleep no matter where you are, then this hotel will be okay for you. But if car horns and bright lights leave you up all night, there are better accommodations in Manhattan.",0

 The room was actually molding The AC system didn t work so the room was a weird temperature and the loo needed the water to be run before you flushed it I took pictures of how run down the room was not four stars at all  They offered a free drink on arrival which was nice but the barman didn t know what one of the advertised drinks was or how to start making it There was no sangria even though it was on the menu and they had all the ingredients and the Chicken wings with blue cheese came with no cheese ,0

 I thought the hotel was very expensive for what it was I expected much better service and facilities I was overcharged and so were my friends we had to have a discussion with reception to put this right I requested early check in and only 1 room was ready My son requested a pot of tea after returning back late at night and was told no Very disappointedNo Positive,0
 a Access the stairs to the first floor were very steep b No power points by the bed I am forced to use a CPAP machine and had problems plugging it in c Holes in the duvet cover d Noise in the alleyway next to the Hotel Room was large and included a sofa and small table The bathroom was well appointed but I did have difficulty in accessing the bath because it had been recessed into an alcove and could only be entered by climbing in the end of the bath,0
 room could if been bigger bed was so comfy and the food was lovely staff great,1
 Room HOT Everything about this hotel is perfect we had a stunning view of Sagrada Familia which is well worth paying extra for Our room was too hot and you couldn t control the air conditioning but the receptionist went out of his way to supply a fan at 4am which rescued our nights sleep When our flight was cancelled due to air strike I booked another night online rang reception and they agreed instantly to let us stay in our same room Staff are the most welcoming friendly and helpful I ve met in any hotel Will be nack,1

No Negative Close proximity to overground buses and taxi Quiet area and friendly staff,1
 This visit I found reception staff a little off hand and disinterested but they provided minimum help when required  Excellent choice for breakfast Service staff very helpful ,1
 In my opinion the bar restaurant could have done with being open earlier for those that like need want to eat earlier  Quality of the room comfort of the room staff professionalism and friendliness cleanliness of the whole hotel ,1
 Why no gym There were some late night revelers in the patio area our first night so we never got to sleep before 2 30 p m  the staff is great and offered much assistance from getting us an airport cab to a haircut The downstairs lounge outdoor area and salon were gorgeous The room was quiet and clean with a nice bath ,1
 Maybe closer to the nearest tube station We requested a quiet room and it was as we had requested We wanted to be close to where we had planned our night out and it was only a five minute walk away ,1

 heating did not work in the room the room was tiered not that clean location,0
 Not great value for money Rooms small and outdated Marks on headboard and rooms generally in need of a facelift  Comfortable beds Friendly staff ,0
 When I ordered a taxi from reception they didn t order someone trusted so the taxi driver thought I was a tourist I used to live there and took 45 minutes to get to my destination which was 6 4km from my hotel If one asks a hotel to book transport one expects a reliable driver I would have got there quicker by bus The staff were so professional they came across and unfriendly No warm welcome or chat just wanted their money and to dispense a ket upon arrival even though I was the only one checking in and there wasn t a queue Breakfast was overpriced The coffee machine in my room didnt work half the time and the mini bar had no alcohol I won t stay again  Clean efficient ,0

 Small room in particular in relation to description penthouse suite Penthouse yes as on top floor but hardly a suite Double room at best No Positive,0
 Overall a poor experience at this hotel Was not told about 30 card deposit when booking online Told the receptionist I did not have right card with me and that I planned to come back He called me on the room phone to reiterate which I thought that was out of order Went out and left the free to clean sign on the door handle but the room was not services upon my return Was expecting a higher standard from this hotel  Convenient location for the day ,0

 The room turned out to be tiny in the backyard with small window and no good light No possibilities to change was offered though requested Location is rather central though Grand Boulevard station was not very convenient to get to sightseeing places as compared with Le Peletier which is a bit far away  Clean,0
 Even though the booking com website stated that the room had 2 beds upon arrival we were told that was only a preference not a certainty  Great location right next to Earl s court location Very spacious apartment considering the size of London s accommodation The apartment is offsite to the main hotel but you still got all the great features of the hotel but without the noise factor ,1
"The Moore is the best price for the location. It is no frills, clean and quiet. There was no closet in the room, so if you have clothes you wish to hang this may be an inconvenience. I did not inquire with the front desk if an iron or hair dryer were available. If these are a necessity you should check with them before booking. The cozy cafe they run is a great place to start the day.",1
 Very expensive breakfast if you wanted to have it in hotel Good location Pleasant staff,1
 There was a lack of information given about the hotel s facilities upon check in The desk staff did not advise us there would be a concierge available later in the day for info how to get around and what to see The service in the dining room was not great Our charge account was charged before it should have been which has resulted in an overcharge on our credit card account  The room was lovely and clean Breakfast was good The price was very reasonable Parking was great The location was good ,0
 A good 15 mins walk from Kings Cross thought it was a little closer Modern and upgraded,1
 Even a delux room for 4 days doesn t include free drinking water Location,0

No Negative location,1
 The breakfast the staff were not attentive when items ran out and the seats were not comfortable as it was part of the bar area Rooftop bar for drinks in the eve,0
"This is not the typical Hampton box with nice-sized rooms. Rather, its nice-sized, well-appointed, quiet, comfy rooms are in a beautiful old office building over a theater (I only wish I was in town longer so I could catch a show.).
Location is great: a few blocks from the elevated train, subway, Grant Park and everything amazing Chicago has to offer. 
I'm so happy I didn't stay at the hotel hosting the conference I attended. Hampton's facilities and staff made the stay pleasantly memorable. 
I'll come back with my wife next time to catch a show downstairs.",1
 Broken glass at the front door Restaurant was overcrowded Far too many tables in such a small space  Priced well for a new years eve trip ,0
 Thee was no fridge in the room and we were not informed of this beforehand Room was somewhat noisy as work thing place outside Handle on window was loose and nearly came away Having stayed several times at the Doubletree at Tower Hill I felt this stay was not as enjoyable  Position cleanliness value ,0
 The location the size of the room didnt match the photo of the room they said i would get the service as coffee maker was broken an they didnt believe us then i had to demand a new 1 juat didnt like the hotel at all an i have stayed in cheaper hotels in amsterdam an they were better Bed was comfty,0

 the room was not a DeLux room location view from room,0
 The room was cold and quite small The location in the heart of the city,1
I have stayed at this hotel on two occaisions and both times I really enjoyed it. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are high quality. We recevied a complimentary fruit basket filled with delicious fresh fruit and bottled water. The bathrooms are good sized and very clean. I would definitely stay there again and woudl recommend it to friends.,1
 Staff are surly and unhelpful The hotel appears to be run for the convenience of the staff rather than the customers Rooms are okay,0
 Not much choice for restaurants near by and not close to the shopping area Not the same setting as I saw on the booking com  Nice setting and near subway ,0
 Our friends paid the same and had the same booking but they had a bath with a tv whereas we had a walk in wet room shower  Quiet and spacious room,0
No Negative Location perfect easy access,1
 On arrival my request for one of the rooms to have an extra bed in it had been lost however it was quickly resolved This room also had no batteries in the TV remote and despite being reported to 2 different staff members it was never rectified The hotel also suffered a power cut in the evening but this was totally out of their control  We were attending a wedding in the grand ballroom and had a thoroughly enjoyable day ,1
 beds and bar sevice breakfast was expencive and poor,0
 TV in room needs a retune but everything else was great  Very helpful and friendly staff Room was very comfortable Continental breakfast was more than adequate ,1
 Air con didn t work They took so long to try and move me I decided to stay put in the room on the 10th floor and the noise outside with the window open is horrendous All ambulances and police in the world seem to drive past with their sirens on  Modern and nice accessible hotel with a great breakfast ,0
 The room we were given on this occasion was little more than a box felt extremely closed in and bed was very uncomfortable could feel every spring Glad we only stayed 1 night on this occasion Superb location always been a great place to stay on previous visits,0
"Despite an assurance for a KingBed and high floor over a phone call, the request was not honored. At check-in request for a King Bedroom or a room upgrade was curtly turned down. The standard reply being """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we are fullly booked"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and that I had arrived late in the evening.I had called the hotel earlier on the day to inform them that I was arriving late in the evening.The tone and demeanor of the the persons who checke me in does not merit a front desk service.
The hotel bar is nice but the quality of drinks(especillay cocktails) and service is poor. Have never eaten in this hotel in my many stays there so don't know about the quality of food or service. The single most advantage of this hotel is its location.",0
 The room was supposed to be one of their best The room smelled musty the furniture was old and uncomfortable the carpets where dirty and frayed ripped in places and the shower had black mould and ingrained dirt on the tiles sealant and grout the roller blind had dead flies embedded on it The restaurant and room service is non existent and the hairdyer didn t work Tried to upload pictures but the site upload isn t working properly and could only upload the one picture Nothing,0
"Bell hop at the hotel made us end or trip on a sour note. He skipped over us in line then made us follow him to get our own bags and said this is a tip service. Yes, if you did the work. What a jerk for four hundred a night they should have treated us better. NEVER COMING BACK and I will pass on to my friends, family, and co-workers. it's a shame it was a great location.",0
 We booked what was called a Superior double room We had a tiny double bedded room in basement really only suitable for single occupancy The space between the end of the bed and the wall was a matter of inches and you had to bend over the bed to avoid hitting the TV Also we elected to include breakfast at a cost of 18 each assuming it was a good cooked breakfast at that price In fact it was only a rather poor Continental breakfast cooked breakfast was 24 each At booking you did not specify type of breakfast Definitely thought this a rip off No Positive,0
 it wasn t possible to adjust the air conditioning or it was terribly cold or hot I told it many times to the staff they always said the maintenance would fix it they never fix it  to be in the center of the town,0

 Very hot rooms Tired looking bedrooms Very untidy decorating in bathrooms m Very polite staff,0
 The room was small and not too comfortable I was charged extra for parking even though I had the impression I d paid for it beforehand  Breakfast was ok parking was safe ,0
 Nothing Everyone very well dressed and presented themselves well very polite and the overall impression was amazing,1
No Negative Good location and price,1
 the reception service is bad clean and nice room confortable,0
 Nothing Everything was great The hotel is located in the area full of restaurants cafes and theaters however they are far enough in order to allow you to fully relax ,1
 Not a nice pool very tiny Breakfast too expensive and not many guests who take it  Nice location nice people everything is possible Good wi fi,0
 Our room right next to the roof top bar walls between rooms that were paper thin so you could hear many conversations in the middle of the night The shower was mostly just tiny drops of water and they charged us for the room on a credit card I didn t want to be charged on before our arrival  The location and the roof top bar,0
 Pillows on the bed were extremely uncomfortable much too hard Sky bar has a 10 people limit on the outside area imposed by the council which spoilt the experience as it was some time before we could go out there and inside the bar was very hot  The Tapas meal was fantastic Very authentic Spanish food,0
 The hotel is very large which I wouldn t mind but here is the problem when it is full it barely copes with the amount of guests it can accommodate It really does spoil the otherwise pleasant experience the restaurant at breakfast is so crowded that you have to wake up early to enjoy it the waiting time for check in and checkout at the reception easily exceeds 20 minutes the pool area is so tiny that getting a sunbed is a great struck of luck  The hotel has perfect location and very good facilities which also includes a pool Very handy during summer Breakfast is pretty good as long as you come early enough to avoid queuing The standard room was spacious and quite modern ,1
 First floor quite room has a view of internal court and service staircase  I ve given few remarks to the duty manager and they were fixed immediately She also sent a fruit basket ,1
 No sound proof rooms lot of noise coming from the corridor my first room it s phone was not working and couldn t call the reception to ask any general information I had to keep going up and down I wanted to extend in the same room but the manager was looking to upsell me a different category with higher price of course Didn t appreciate this action at all  Looks nice in general which is tricky as nice is not what a guest needs,0
"The Sofitel is a great location in Midtown, convenient to Times Square, theatres, Radio City etc.
The bar is bistro style, the restaurant is quite good. I have stayed here at least a dozen times and the service has been flawless. The rooms are tastefully done, well sized for NYC and quiet.",1
 Staff were quite unfriendly the night porter on Saturday night was unpleasant and aggressive the room wasn t fully serviced until we asked for it to be and the pillows were really poor overall not what you would expect for almost 200 per night  Location was central and room size was good ,0
No Negative Rooms and staff,1
 I cannot see why this hotel can be rated with four stars The room was very average and the beds were separated in the middle It was a very average room and not at all what I expected I only slept over night however do not go here thinking it is a four star hotel The lobby is very small and I did not like the smell it smelled stale and maybe like smoke I would not reccomend this place due to the fact is is not a four star hotel maybe a three star No Positive,0
 Well to be honest it was all very good But spa and sauna facilities would be amazing  great room great bathroom fantastic breakfast staff friendly attentive but also totally professional Especially happy to discover my window could open did someone read my previous review ,1
 Hotel is a little dated the bedroom was quite basic and need in updatingNo Positive,0
 The bathroom had broken furniture we booked it and there were a lot of hidden charges not just the city tax which I always check but 100 deposit not mentioned anywhere I don t take my cards abroad for security reason but it states we can authorise your card for payment this was not the case as I didn t have my card with me although I had all identification that it was me Staff weren t the friendliest I would defiantly never stay again or recommend it to anyone  The lounge area was superb the room it s self was ok not the Eat bit small,0
No Negative The bed was perfect service impeccable it was what i imagine flawless ,1
 Paid almost 880 for two rooms on New Year s Eve and didn t get much sleep as noise from other room travels along air vents Woke up at 3 30 am with noise that you thought people where in your room talking this continued till5 30 am by the wY 809 does not include breakfast This is an extra 20 per head Handy location for tubes etc Close to Whertherspoons Good room service food,0
 Location is a little away from the main sites but didn t bother me all too much in the end  The room was well appointed comfortable and stylish Staff were friendly and very helpful ,1
No Negative The personnel were very welcoming and helpful,1
 We choose a Superior Room and what we got in our opinion was a Basic Room with a roof skylight we have used hotels for over 20 years in Amsterdam this was a Basic room at Superior prices only its central location is good Wouldn t risk recommending it to a friend Central location,0
 I selected this hotel as a late booking Considering that normally this room would have cost over 300 I was disappointed I have stayed in higher quality rooms for a fraction of the price There weren t even any biscuits let alone complimentary water in the fridge the cleanliness was of a high standard but the room was small and average I felt that despite the late booking discount I was paying for location rather than accommodation  Staff were very friendly although on check in there is an assumption that all visitors require a passport Concierge were very accommodating in holding my baggage for most of the check out day whilst I did a little sightseeing before catching a late train Hooking into the Wi Fi presented no issues ,0
 Basement family room was extremely hot not sure how effective the air con was  The whole stay was lovely Unfortunately we had to wait a while for our rooms to be ready beyond check in times but staff were very apologetic and we received complimentary breakfast for the delay ,1
No Negative Sauna room,1
"Stayed for a few stop over days. Good walking access to shops and restaurants. Pool deck quirky but fun for the kids. Rooms full of gadgets, TVs, fun fittings and well sized. Overall cleanliness is average. Leather couches are in need of a good clean. The rooms lighting is terrible - you dress in the dark and really struggle to put on make up. Better in house dining at other LA hotels in the area. You have to like very modern and not want any of the plush hotel experience. So much for the gadgets - you have to pay for Internet!!!!!!",0
"What can you expect from a ----room New York hotel ? Convenient location (many tourist and business attractions are at walking distance), efficient service and comfortable bedrooms. The Intercontinental New York Barclay has all that. However, for --- USD you can also expect flat panels TVs and recent furniture. Room size was OK but bathroom size was ridicously small. Actually I have rarely seen such a small bathroom !! Room service was efficient and breakfast quite good. Unless the property goes through full renovation I would definitely recommend picking up another hotel in the area.",0
No Negative Location great,1
 The constant interruption in my sleep by housekeeping I loved the location,1
"What a great hotel! We stayed for two nights on a road trip to Memphis and were pleasantly surprised by the accomodations. The room was spacious and well appointed. The hotel is close to the famous Rendezvous BBQ as well as just a few blocks from Beale Street and the trolley lines.
The staff is helpful and the hot breakfast is great!",1
 Noisy due to construction word and DLR nearby Room a little shabby cables exposed to TV cracked wash basin in en en suite carpet fraying in places Dated wallcovering Didn t realise booking was for room without windows when reserving Would regard hotel as 3 star at best Spacious room albeit odd shape Good views,0
 The room wasn t clean and there s no sleepersNo Positive,1
"I stayed hotel Moncaco for a week in December. I am a business traveler and travel every weeks in different states of US. The hotel is located in a very convenient location. China town is opposite to the hotels. There are lots of resturants and food place that you can try. 
The only flaw of this hotel is the FRONT DESK service. The front desk service was terrible. They need to improve the service. Becasue of the Front Desk's service I switched this hotel.",0
"The reception team was first class in helping us; in particular, warm, friendly Evelynne (my wife's description). Concierge was also very helpul in helping us find places to visit etc. Also, our booking changes were handled very well by Valary. Thanks to a great team!
The Crowne Plaza is ideally situated for exploring Times Square and Manhatten.",1
"We travel a lot and have stayed at many - star hotels, but with the high prices in NYC, we had to opt for something more reasonable. Sofitel NY could easily qualify for a - star in our opinion. It was in the middle of NYC, a few blocks to the Time Square, Radio City Music Hall, Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, all the shopping on the -th Avenue, and had a great view of the Chrysler Building. We even walked to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Natural History, the Empire State Building, Union Square, and Soho. Perfect location for tourists. Service was excellent, too. Very clean and neat. It also had free internet access with a printer by the lobby -- hours, which was very convenient. Highly recommended!",1
"Just a basic hampton inn. Fruit on the bar was spoiled and I had to get the manager to change out. Beds were not that great. Decided not to stay there is but one night. Staff was OK, but not spectacular.",0
 The radiators and pipes were banging all night on our first night so didnt sleep and the workmen started work at 7 20 outside which meant I literally had 3 hrs sleep The next night we turned the radiators off Good nights sleep  Beds were comfy Room was nice and airy we had a superior double The breakfast was excellent and the staff were lovely ,1
 Some of the rooms are really close to the breakfast room hence people who wake up earlier than you can wake you up when you want to sleep more No Positive,0
 you had to pay for the mini bar in our room which wasn t stated until we rang up reception to ask before we got a hefty bill  staff were amazing so friendly from the start from the very end We were asked if we had visited before and because we hadn t we were given a map of the city and told what services and tourist attractions were close as well as a metro map and directions of how to get to places The room was one of the best bits bed is so comfy ,1
 nothing to say I like very much and I like to visit again,1
 Nichts Alles,1
No Negative Food and service,1
 We where really disappointed with the bedroom we had it was a treat night away we got given a queen bed that was made up of 2 single beds and was really uncomfortable with the gap in the middle when your time like ours is so precious you just want it to be perfect but I feel strongly that if your offering queen beds that is what they should be I would of rather had a double bed which would of made our experience staying there more pleasurable I feel the location for what we need was very good the Buffett breakfast was very good too No Positive,0
 Our first room was awful it wasn t even close to what is shown on the pictures Also the receptionist who checked us in was a little bit condescending Later that day receptionist G lten helped us move to a better room and take care of us  Our Second room was very nice ,1
 Rooms pictures are different from reality as its too small Very good location,0
 Staff at reception was unprofessional we had to give passports twice because they forgot to give third room and looked at us very surprised why we are not walking away to our rooms Rooms are tiny double room had only one set of towels one robe and slippers Non smokers where placed into smoking floor and room noone asked if this is ok Breakfast so so very superfically  Complimentary rose during meeting,0
 The room is too small Location and the price also the staff,1
 Smoke and some smell on floor The ventilation not to my liking  Location,0
 I paid for whifi Do you not have a free whifi for guests i was not told about it on check in so ended up paying for it over 12 RidiculousNo Positive,0
 A rather small back of house bedroom which was either boiling hot or feeeziing cold depending on whether you wanted to be in air con fug or have the window open Breakfast in the sitting room had very slow service with one poor waitress trying her best  Location decoration,0
"Great location, the place is exactly like described. Very clean. Host is very responsive and welcoming. Would 100% recommend this place!",1

 Very poor furniture and room service care Many comments about the bathroom cleanliness and daily care Telephone in the room not conected to anything as I wanted to make some calls or even reach the reception but it wasn t working The bed got only vely light cover sheets Everynight we felt cold and had to switch off the AC  Easy access welcoming staff and good location ,0

 Lots of pubic hair in the shower tray that was not ours Room decor was very tired and needs re decorating No hot water in the shower only Luke warm Air conditioning would not blow cool air Staff abrupt in the lounge bar Food was good and handy having a car park,0
 In other countries this hotel will have no more than 2 stars It s dirty old and not refurbished Location is not excellent for anything Even if it s close to Lima Metro station you cannot do too much on Buenos Aires The same shops are near Dom Church and the area is more attractive  Even if ti s on the Buenos Aires Street there are quiet rooms and you can sleep well Breakfast is decent ,0
 The bed is a bit small and moves quite a lot The room is also a bit small for a supposedly 4 stars hotel The lobby is also unusually small More plugs and more storage room would be nice A bit pricey but it seems these are Barcelona standards for the season  The personal is very friendly The room and the bathroom is clean and nice The location is very central on a main avenue so a bit noisy and no particular view The pool and jacuzzi are ok but shouldn t be at the center of your decision ,1
 Heating never got above 19 4 no matter how much we turned it up and hot water was no more than warm moved room and still no better No Positive,0
 all good location quality of rooms excellent breakfast and great service,1
 Staff and the fact that they stole our iPhone charger and cable from the room  Location and breakfast buffet ,0
 Staff weren t approachable eager to assist Staff on check in were rude answering the phone in the middle of dealing with me not once but twice just checking in as this was a first impression it wasn t great Room small but clean Breakfast tables were far too close together no cups on table or cutlery had to ask  Location great just down from harrods,0
 Breakfast could be improved The beds were really comfy,1
 The bed was slightly sunken down the middle Everything else was almost perfect  The staff were always very attentive friendly and helpful Very welcoming atmosphere and the bar was very vibrant The health club was great and had all the amenities The restaurants were amazing for the breakfast included but we ate only at the Roux The restaurant staff are very professional and always willing to check anything you need and Sebastian is great Definitely would stay again and was a beautifully decorated hotel for Christmas Location is top for eating and shopping ,1
 The lifts were a bit of a nightmare if you didn t swipe your room key promptly you could end up on any floor  The hotel was very modern and sophisticated I really liked the whole set up and it is located a couple of minutes walk from the tube ,1
No Negative The staff were very friendly and polite The single room was comfortable and thoughtfully laid out A small thing that I particularly liked was that bottled water in the room which I drank was replaced by a fresh bottle when the room was cleaned Something that many larger hotels fail to do I think it reflects the attention to detail The bed was comfy and the room on the back of the building very quite overnight even though I had the window open The decor is not the most contemporary but its a Georgian building and it suits the style It was a great location and a good price for a central London hotel in July I will definitely book again,1
 1 During check in got the feeling that they wanted to get us off of their desk asap 2 The hotel is far away from the city centre will take a day to get your head around the tram system 3 The reception staff was not friendly 4 Asked for a universal plug via phone I was asked to come to reception only to be told that there are no plugs available 4 Asked for an ice bucket got a few pieces of ice in a plastic bag  The room was clean Bed was comfortable,0

 Bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds Booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double roomsNo Positive,0
 Partial shower doors don t make any sense I guess this is the trend in most European countries but a shower curtain could add so much functionality if a full shower door cannot be afforded  Beautiful room in the city center but away from all the chaos of the city good spread at breakfast very friendly staff and service ,1
 Nothing second time this year i stayed and will be returning next time Great staff great locations and the rooms are large for amsterdam,1
 Nothing There was a good selection of breakfast and was delicious,1

 The rooms are extremely small as I had booked superior double I was disappointed but didn t let it ruin the trip I suppose this is to be expected in London for the price  The bed was definitely comfortable Hotel itself has a nice old traditional English feel to it Location just opposite Hyde park was fantastic ,1

"It appears this hotel has been recently converted to a Holiday Inn Expres. I think that they did an amazing job with this conversion. It is very modern and very clean! The breakfast was very typical of any Holiday Inn Express, which was great! The convenient freeway access made our travles around San Diego great. I would definately stay here again.",1
 Breakfast was disappointingoing No tea or coffee refills and poor quality bakery products The room was comfortable Particularly liked the huge rainfall shower and toiletries,0

No Negative Everything was excellent staff room location transport etc,1
 There were only coffee making facilities in the room no tea This was brought when we asked It said free newspapers but it was only the Times which is free and we ordered the Telegraph It would have been nice to have that explained Other than that everything was great No Positive,1
 Disappointed to find lots of maintenance work going on The nice bar downstairs doubled up as a breakfast room and smelt like it Whole place was surrounded by scaffolding Should have been told about that beforehand Not good enough at that priceNo Positive,0
 The size and standard of the room wasn t what I expected from the price we paidNo Positive,0
 I was given a tiny room with no window broken light and funny smell I mean is it even legal to have a bedroom with no window It was then swapped for a single room with a window but gosh this place needs some serious updating It s not cheap enough to justify the bad state of facilities and rooms  Location close to tube,0
 There weren t much varieties at the brrakfast hall which was surprising We didn t have any mobile phone connection in the rooms so had to use the room s telephone which was highly expensive The staff were really kind and our room was really big and clean ,1
No Negative Great location Stunning decor in rooms Fantastic breakfast ,1
 The hotel seems to be better in picture In reality the room was too claustrophobic There was no staff to help us with the luggage We had to drag the heavy luggage ourselves Reception was a podium with a single person with laptop attending the guests Me n my daughter felt disgusting with the hospitality after such a long journey from India We recommend to go with branded hotel chains No Positive,0
 Tiny room  Hotel was quirky and professional ,1
 Was surprisingly too small for amount of money paid Located near great Paris sites and Metro,0
 The room was apparently an upgrade but was tiny the bathroom was bigger than the room space We applied for extra upgrade with hotels deals programme but were not told when we arrived that we had not got one so were instantly disappointed when getting in the room There were inadequate free drinking facilities No free water Only 3 coffee pods and 3 tiny plastic milk things Not even a complimentary biscuit  The bathroom and the modern upgrade of rooms Breakfast staff very polite and welcoming Water my European lady with black hair Was totally charming,0
 In our room the window didn t open and the air conditioning didn t work we were however offered a fan for the evening but at a cost of 135 per evening I think that was a disgrace and I probably wouldn t go back and stay there First impressions last and all that  The location and views and the breakfast and we even left some items behind and they returned them at a cost but they returned them promptly once I had been in touch ,0
 They gave us a very noisy room near the staff room we ve been very disturbed by all the noise an the staff talking And the breakfeast is very poor a shame for a five stars hotels in paris I saw better in a 3 starsNo Positive,0
"I stayed at the HarborView Inn & Suites for a three-day convention in June. They were very accommodating as they switched my room with a swift & smooth mode at my request. The room was clean, comfy, and relaxing with the view of the ocean and city from my window. Having cable was a nice touch as well as the new furniture that was just being put in. Being in the middle of the city, restaurants, residences, and transportation, made everything feel close to home. If I need to return to downtown San Diego, I would definitely book this hotel again. Nice touch Harbor View!",1
No Negative Disco style of the hotel is the great The elevator with the disco ball blinking flor is awesom Personal are very friendly ,1
 everything far to much to mention apart from the friendly and helpful young lady at reception there was nothing at all to like the room was like a cell completely charmless that looked out on to a drab concrete office block witch was only about 15f away which meant curtains had to be closed all the time,0
"Stayed here for - nights and were impressed by this well managed hotel; great (if not huge) rooms, clean, quiet (at --th fl) and well appointed. perfect location just round the corner from Moma, -th Av, Rockefeller Center etc. And absolutely amazing value with a $--- rate found online.

 Room was very small and the location was slightly out of town Although the tram No 13 located just behind the hotel took you straight into Central Station The trams do close around midnight during the week so if you are planing late nights this hotel not for you as you will have to take a taxi home Also no vending machines which I think would be a plus as they charge 3 for a very small bottle of water which I think is a rip off  Staff were pleasant Sun roof terrace great No 13 tram stop just located at back of hotel,0

 I was woken up at 8 am with an internal phone call telling me you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door please change it the porter is waiting at your door to change the hairdryer I never asked for the hairdryer to be changed never even used it when I told the reception that I wouldn t like it to happen again they replied we don t really apologize for it they only call if there s a necessity well that was definitely not one in addition I bought an umbrella on a rainy day and the next day it went missing from my room would not stay here again and would not recommend it to anyone No Positive,0

 Room space Everything,1
 The room has no window to the outside meaning I had no fresh air or any idea how is the weather outside It will be fair if the hotel categorize this type of room in separate category some hotels do I d rather stay in a two star hotel with window than feeling trapped in a room like this in a four star hotel The room is not worth this price  Central location about 600 meters from Pla a de Catalunya La Rambla Nice area near bars resturants Clean hotel ,1
 AIreland conditions not as we need was great location staff,1
 One lift was broken the entire time and then the second lift broke as well Big service charge to sit and have a drink which wasn t mentioned at the time of ordering No free internet with the room purchase  Close to the tube ,1
 Could hear a lot of noise from outside music we playing until 3 am The floors are very thin and also noise outside the rooms is very loud Would only recommend as a business hotel or one night stop over Access to main attractions is a long walk or taxi  Immaculate and very clean Beautiful rooms,0
 I didn t like the cleaning it was not bad but it needs To be more cleaner  I liked the collection ,0
 The views from my room I stayed in room 603 I could only see pipes outside my window The bed was really comfortable,1

 Not hot water first night Then no power to wall sockets next day Inconsistency Location,0
 The check in is very slow and the lifts are a nightmare to use as they don t make it clear to people that they need to use their room key You often see the same people just going up and down in very full lifts not able to figure out why the lift hasn t stopped on their floor  the location is good,0
 The bell at the bottom of the cavernous and tight ramp to exit the underground car park was irksome since by the time you had reached the exit point the automatic gate closed very quickly It would be much better if this bell to contact reception was located near the exit point The quality of the restaurant food was good ,1
 One particular member of the check in wasnt very personable  We like the location,1

"We stayed during the week for one evening. 
It was an attractive room (king suite) and clean, however, we had some difficulities adjusting the heat. It would not respond when trying to lower the temperature. In fairness to the hotel, we did not alert them about this since it was late evening. Another issue included being first assigned to a room that was already occupied (based on the clothes on the floor upon entering). We notified the front desk and were assigned another room promptly but it was a little embarrassing for all. The continental breakfast was worth attending although there are better choices close by if you are looking for a made-to-order meal.
Overall, the rate (government) was good at $--. For future visits, we would probably look elsewhere since there are so many choices nearby.",0
"Great Hotel, in a fab location, but very very small room. Mindyou it had everything, but no room to move so felt a little claustrophobic. Windows wouldnt open either and air con too noisy. Very clean and bed changed daily so that was a luxury. Very busy street, so very noisey all night, but was so tired from sight seeing that didnt really matter. Breakfast is nice but expensive and we also had to wait over --- for it on our first day, so didnt return to eat at the hotel after that. Their web site says it has a lively bar, which is has, but generally for the older client, as in plus --, so a little too old for me and hubby. New York is great adn this hotel is good for a short stay",0
 Everything Nothing at all,0
No Negative Cozy rooms with accurate care for facilities it is indeed a home away from home All details are taken into account from the soap to the breakfast the free whiskey or the piano Just a comment if your room is on the upper floor you will be awaken by the noises comming from the breakfast room,1
 The carpet and upholstery were stained and torn The bathtub was not properly cleaned with a large amount of hair from the previous guest shaving still left in the tub We used the shower instead and the hair still remained in the tub on the second day after the room was serviced There was no complementary water in the refrigerator as stated on the front of said refrigerator  Bed was very comfortable Location was great Staff was pleasant ,0

 The furniture can be change It old deserve to be on pension No Positive,0
 The Hotel itself stands out like a saw thumb because it is dated inside and out compared to the surrounding buildings and could do with a major face lift The rooms are very dark and could do with being brightened up and also have more lights put in them  The Location is perfect for anyone wanting to stay in Canary Wharf and commute to Excel and the surrounding areas even central London etc because the DLR and Jubilee Line has a great service ,0
 Dated Position,0
"This motor inn was close to the tourist areas and within walking distance to Fisherman Wharf, Cable car route and many restaurants including Chinatown and Little Italy. We stayed for a week and found the staff extremely helpful and friendly.
Laundry attached to hotel.
Only issue was we were in the rooms facing the main road and very noisey with pedestrian and vehicles travellng past. resulted in wearing earplugs. The rooms are certainly old, tv old analogue and our room smelt a little musty. Though may sound like a few negatives the location was good so ask for a room not near the main road.
We did enjoy our stay in San Fran and our room was really a bed at the end of the day and the rooms were clean which is what we want.",0

 Attitude of the concierge and some receptionists charging a deposit for an umbrella is not acceptable which is annoying to even ask for a 10 gbp deposit for it where all other hotels are throwing at you foc poor room conditions really worn down needs refurbishing badly and needs to be upscaled a bit  Konum,0
 room keys used to automatically deactivate roof pool is very small  The location is near to everything hotel price is so much reasonable to the service they offer food quality is amazing staff are friendly and helpful place is clean no interruptions so issues everything went easy and seamless ,1
"It was worth the $-- per night. The hotel itself is basic. The room was basic with nondescript appointments and basically clean. Some areas are tired looking and-or unkempt. I was there the first two nights of the Indiana State Fair and the hotel was packed but I did not hear anyone through the walls or door. The surrounding area has several fast food places, some basic restaurants and a Target across the street. It is within -- minutes of the Children's Museum, downtown and the airport. Overall, I did receive what I paid for.",0

Set aside this, walked in only to be greated by some girl who doesn't know what she is doing, holds the phone in her pocket with the ringer turned off!! What's that about!!?? First hotel I have ever walked in to that had the pool right there in lobby!!! Hotel is dated and clean enough, I guess, but given all the other things so wrong with it--we didn't bother staying. Go up on more exit for nicer safer hotels and convenient reputable restaurants!!!",0

All staff from the front desk to housekeeping were polite and pleasant - really made us feel welcome. Very clean rooms.

Take the cable cars (either one) to Union Square for shopping. Take the Powell-Hyde cable car to Lombard Street and Chinatown. Very good breakfast - nice selection of food.

 Bed a little hard Card needed to be reset twice to use lift  Room was warm and comfortable Breakfast was really excellent Loved the lounge area with coffee available and bag storage ,1

 Room was very small Location Quirky Friendly,1
 Luckily we are relatively slim otherwise the narrow shower stall would have been a problem Valet parking costs 14 Euros  Good breakfast by most standards although very little whole grain bread or rolls For that a large selection of sliced fresh fruit and dried fruit We enjoyed the giant Italian prunes Marmelades average Hotel location is convenient a few blocks from cathedral and Scala opera house Good restaurants cafes and snack bars in the neighborhood Helpful reception desk staff ,1

 Not a bad hotel but never 5 in a million years The guy claiming to be the manager on duty at 5 30pm on the 3rd Feb I had my doubts was hopeless I needed to move my booking and was happy to pay the difference but he just kept repeating a script rather than listening He forced me to call booking com the next day who guess what then had to call the hotel to ask them to do what I had asked which they did Complete waste of time The bed and pillows weren t v comfortable either and the room a bit pokey  Good location close to lots of the key central London areas The girls on reception were very helpful ,0
 The location  Breakfast the staff there It s a good start to the day they were pleasant and we appreciated their hard work ,0
 Our room was ridiculously hot And I mean Hot A portable air con unit that you needed the window open for Obviously needed to close the window at night The window blinds didn t work so had the lights from the building opposite and from the store cupboard outside our window glaring through the window all night And did I mention RIDICULOUSLY HOT  Our room was a nice size ensuite and tea making facilities We were on the lower ground floor ,0
 Booking charged me like 2 days before and hotel charged me the second time after check out They said that money would be returned however 1week later still no money returned So be careful significant amount would be blocked for a long time Hope that they will return them at least over next 30 days Location is really good I arrived late so it was really good that nearby restoran was still open ,1
 Rooms too small bathroom smelled of drainageNo Positive,0
 some staff Breakfast Location,1
 The location while quiet and peaceful was a bit too far from the city for me personally Also my partner and I definitely saw streetwalkers at night Not sure there s anything anyone can do about that one but just to people know if they walk around later at night with children  I loved the ease of everything If I needed to print something keep my luggage on hold borrow an iron etc everything was done with a smile speed and simplicity ,1
 Demolition work next door Small room Charming old fashioned hotel Friendly staff,1
No Negative I simply loved staying there,1
 The cleanliness was poor in room and in everywhere else too The pool was closed for a day when we were there for 3 days so quite disappointing for the kids For us as well but rather for them Staff was so so Some kind manager some rather useless No sofa bed was made up on arrival although notice was given No means for putting it up later either other than bringing the bedding over Poor performance Breakfast was under cooked in all means no any veggies was offered at all  The pool was good and the sauna and steam room and the jacuzzi The room was spacious ,0

 Quite Location room size,1
 Not as central as we thought Loved the rooms and comfortable bed the breakfast was very good with plenty of variety,1
 I think hotel needs renovation Also there was a problem with the AC Although staff offered kindly to change the room The Executive room did not have access to lounge or so The only difference was the size of the room and the free snacks  Staff was professional responsive to our demands We were three when we first arrived We needed a room for 3 people first night and the following day the room would be left for one guest only Although it took the staff sometime to allocate the room and so on I was impressed how the manger managed the situation noting that I reserved an executive room He allocated the room and he asked me professionally to pay for the extra bed Also to check on guests per checking in the room was a nice complementary gesture ,0

 It is definitely not a 4 star hotel in my opinion I picked this hotel instead of others which were also offering breakfast because it claimed to be a 4 star but this is not the case Also the shower was not very clean After a couple of minutes it accumulates water which is an indication that there are many hairs It was only for a night so I didn t bother Finally the room was quite small even without a chair  Location was nice and the staff friendly but nothing more A typical 2 3 stars hotel ,0
 The fact that De Hallen was overbooked The cleanliness of Vondelhotel The noise at night and in the morning The suite smelled very damp and stuffy old and old fashioned airco Not a lot of bathroom amenities Very poor TV signal The chair at the desk was very uncomfortable and too low compared to the height of the desk  The spaciousness of a suite as an upgrade The bath tub and bathroom,0

"Stayed at the Rex Hotel for - days during our California trip, when we arrived I was 
disappointed to find a small, dismal looking hotel with a front entrance that was decidedly tatty. Our room was extremely small and the air conditioning noisy. Most unimpressive, but quaint
and old fashioned in the dining room-bar, a novelty free glass of wine every evening and
complimentary Wi-Fi. Staff very pleasant and helpful, but if you want upmarket this is not the place for you.",0

"There are not many things to do around the hotel. I reserved for three days but we only stayed one, there was no charge as we adviced with -- hours in advance. 
Rooms are OK, and clean.
Management a bit on the rough side, probably they didn't like us to go, but didn't any effort to convince us otherwise.",0
 Room dimly lit No free wi fi Odd sockets so not many places to charge phones etc had to phone reception and find an extension lead hidden in a cupboard Some noise from adjacent rooms Good location close to Royal Albert Hall for Proms ,1
"Was greeted with friendly staff. The hotel was full the night before, but they went above and beyond to find us a room at -pm. We were very disappointed that the hotel bar is not open on Sunday. We are in Baltimore, a football town!!!!! Although this Marriott was much less hectic than the Baltimore Waterfront Marriott around the corner, it's rooms were not as nice. I would stay here again. Great location.",1
 That my room didn t get cleaned in the day time one of the days I wanted it done And when I first arrived the room floor had a crisp on it So made me feel like it wasn t cleaned  Loved the spa The room was nice and a good size Beautiful views ,1

"We booked a room here in a hurry as we had to fly to Houston to attend a funeral. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and I have never had as terrible and frightening an experience as I had at this hotel. The place was crawling with prostitutes and seedy looking guys looking for prostitutes. We tried to stay here anyway, but the night manager started threatening us! In the end we had to call the police in order to safely leave. The police were very sympathetic, and apparently they have frequent problems with this hotel. Stay Away.",0
 Complimentary dinner was magnificent  Only issue we had was that the aircon didn t work in our first room After many attempts to fix it we were eventually moved to a junior suite ,1
 The building site next door if your room is on that side smell of receen glue made the room smell plus the noise of the guards talking all night while we was sleeping and dogs Barking because they are left in van waking everyone up It has great location plus very friendly stuff nice and clean very helpful,1
"This hotel had a very beautiful lobby but therooms were just average. They were very expensive. The pool was very small and you had to have reservations for the pool.

 Maiden entered rooms without knocking we where disturbed by their noise in the corridor during the full 3 days  Breakfast buffet was good internet was working correctly as well ,0
 Breakfast included in the rates but poor in variety Pillows and bed not properly comfortable  The best reason you should choose this hotel is the great position bus available in front of the hotel and metro stop at less than 2 mins by walk to reach the center in less than 20 mins Room dimensions could be sufficient Staff is really kind and available to provide any help Good quality price ratio ,1

"We've stayed there a few times and would do so again. 
Some rooms face towards the city and the railroad tracks are very nearby with freight trains moving through at times all night long. The hotel does supply earplugs in those rooms. We prefer the waterfront rooms which have nice views over the water to the dock area with large cranes for large ships.  Ferries go by too.
 Desk staff is friendly. The resturAnt has a very nice view and a good happy hour. Breakfasts also fine although some wait staff left quite a bit to be desired.
 The rooms have gas fireplaces but we've noticed they can have problems lighting and we have had to get a maintenance man up repeatedly to crawl around on the floor to light them.",1

"We spent - days at The Doubletree at the end of February and found it to be great. It's more like a small European Boutique hotel than part of a big chain. Our room on the -th floor was clean and well appointed. We loved the location in Little Italy. You can walk to many great restaurants and shops. The trains (Coaster and Trolley) were a short walk away and can take you as far north as Carlsbad and Mexico to the south. The Gaslamp district is a - minute walk away. Despite it's location near the freeway and airport, it was very quiet. The pool deck is excellent. Again, very clean. The hotel staff is friendly and seemed very happy to be there.

 Small cramped room Central,0
 The shower s water pressure was insufficient in our room No Positive,1
 Bed wasn t very much comfortable Wish there were double bed Breakfast was variety of choices Love it Room was big enough for the 3 people,1
 They should not allow 2 people to share a double room the bed was too small and there was literally no room to move around even though it was a deluxe They should only offer double rooms to singles and require a queen bed for those sharing a bed We didn t sleep both nights  Nice staff helpful large choice for breakfast,0
 Service in bar was sometimes a bit slow  Excellent location no noise problem in spite of busy area we were on 5th floor nice bar and restaurant comfy bed and big room ,1
 Can t think of anything Great location 2 minutes walk to la ramblas 5 min walk to secure parking with discount metro station outside lovely hotel with roof top bar,1
 Hotel currently undergoing a refurb so the major of guests I m sure disabled guests must be accounted for have to go up one flight of stairs from reception to the first floor where the lifts to all levels are located Just bear in mind if you re unable to use stairs for some reason  Very comfortable beds excellent breakfast included in our room rate Sky TV channels very central location just behind Fortnums and within a 5 min walk of either Green Park or Piccadilly Circus tube stations ,1
 Air con didn t work Beds were hard We had no bath and weren t told as we had just done a 100 mile bike ride Food for breakfast was cold and very limited as it wasn t being topped up regularly  Very little noise coming from the hotel ,0
 The smell that emanated from my bathroom room 225 precisely The manager Ivana was great When I complained of an issue relating to a stench in my bathroom she took time to hear me out and even went with me to see for herself and finally gave me a 50 percent discount for the discomfort I hope that the problem will be fixed ASAP And to all the other staff that had smiles on their faces to make our stay more welcoming We say thank you The meal served for the party was sumptuous as well Kudos to the chef of the day ,1

 Poor responsiveness to guest requests Poor speed of serviceNo Positive,0
 Very poor check in The concierge never once looked at me when I was booking in He mumbled and it was difficult to understand him He also gave me the incorrect information so I had to re queue to sort out my booking He should not be at the front desk No Positive,0
 Overall a bit too dark Airco was not working sticky in the room 6 for a very small glas of vine is too much Nice garden terrace very close to the next Metro station,0
 The initial check in process could have been better explained regarding pre authorisation on credit card for deposit purposes however it was handled with a smile The confusion lead to a bit of a money issue but this was resolved within a couple of hours of me contacting the hotel directly which was a huge positive point for after sales service  Staff very friendly and helpful throughout Location absolutely brilliant beside mueseum quarter Vondel park and Liedseplein where all the action is You can walk anywhere within 25mins from the hotel Room was quaint and had everything needed no complaints on cleanliness either ,1

 Hotel staff held my bags and I had to pay 70 quid the hotel is old and dirty never stay here ever Nothing,0
 At 11 at night are bathroom ended up flooded because of a drain issue Somehow the cleaning staff managed to overlook a plastic cup clogging the drain My belief is then that there s no way they cleaned the shower before we arrived Absolutely disgusting  The reception staff Claudio especially was excellent Very attentive and kind,0
 The staff never let you feel welcomed On the day of departure we checked out and left luggages in the hotel When we came back to pick them up they couldn t find one of them It was half an hour later when they found it somewhere We were getting late for our flight but the front desk staff didn t seem concerned at all and not a single person apologized to us for this No Positive,0
 I stayed one night and that was disaster Our room was next to elevator and it was totally noisy All of them was not slightly slept until 2 00 Room was not clean and just one big towel So many people in the reception and morning buffet I could not believe why hotel booked so big noisy group in a same time No Positive,0
 The tiny room that I stayed it was very hot and uncomfortable And the breakfast didn t have many options just a couple of cereals and coffee  Good location,0

 Location too far from underground station  Rooms very well appointed ,1
 Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please  Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar ,0
 Our room wasn t ready for us to check in on time Checked in an hour late  It was a great location Staff were very friendly ,1

 Room was cleanish the extra attention to detail would have made the biggest difference For example the info folder has loads of crumbs in it from previous guests  Hotel is well located Breakfast is 10e with limited hot food but if you are patient it is good value in comparison to cafes in the area public transport is great On tram route 14 and only 15 mins from Damage Square,0

 Booking com didn t inform the Hilton we upgraded and although they tried to help us I m not convinced we received an upgraded room it was very basic and disappointing and I would like a refund for the upgrade  The staff were very good,0
 i stayed for one night it was the same rate as the hilton plaza where i stayed for the nights prior and does not come close to the hilton  the location was great,0
 Over priced for what it is Location not great train and metro needed to get to city centre Very little around hotel Not good value for money at current price Basic hotel accommodation Had tea coffee facilities and desk if need to do work ,0
 hotel seemed very tired Cramped and untidy reception area dirty carpets sullen looking cleaning staff in the corridors Generally all just a bit shabby especially considering the price This was certainly not one of the best London hotels I have stayed in good location friendly reception and bar staff although waiting staff at breakfast were very distracted and forgot to bring our toast despite a request ,0

No Negative Staff friendly and very accommodating Good customer service Good location and hotel was within working distance to the underground to access central London Would definitely book again ,1
 Generally unfriendly and unsmiling staff Its not too much to expect reception door or breakfast room staff to greet you warmly and look at you when arriving and departing Here staff were too busy staring at their desk top computer screens or requesting my room number to even say good morning afternoon or evening  location size of room view from terrace over Passieg reasonable breakfast,0
 It was an extremely dated hotel Needs a serious revamp  Staff were nice ,0

No Negative Location good,1
 I spent a total of 9 days on the road in northern Europe and of all the hotels I stayed at the Park Plaza was by far the most expensive but the room and hotel amenities were the worst of all my stays The location is great but the hotel is under construction and still charging beyond premium prices Small room and small bathroom The bed was uncomfortable and to get to the fitness area required a trip down the elevator across the lobby up an elevator across a hallway and then back down another elevator Overall I would recommend looking elsewhere  The location is right in the heart of Amsterdam ,0
 1 Staff weren t overly friendly 2 Pool was closed one day 3 Bar wasn t open 4 Cleaners tried to come into room twice despite do not disturb signbeing on 5 Room was too dark not enough lights 6 Not enough paid sockets That we had a double bed rather than 2 together A complimentary bottle of wine was left in room as it was our honeymoon,0

No Negative Ok,1
No Negative Nothing,0
 not like the booking ad promised the choice was about location The hotel was a bit disappointing Very small room work in progres inside and invisible staff,0
 It s location as it isn t that central but it s very close to the Eiffel Tower The staff were extremely nice they met all our needs the food is to die for the room was always clean and it s really cosy and welcoming I would totally recommend it to anyone visiting Paris,1
 The room double room relatively small specially if compared to Barcelona standard no balcony no natural lighting very depressing even the entrance of the lobby is almost nonexistent I never felt in a 4 star hotel and I find the place really overrated  Friendly staff and comfy bed ,0

 Staff knocked my door at 8am I dont understand No Positive,0
"Stayed in place in November ----. Arranged booking with an online service. I was grossly overcharged - by over $--- per night - over what someone who came in off the street paid. This hotel is adequate but you have to watch out they don't dip into your pocket more than is appropriate. They advertise a free breakfast and, while my expectations were not high on this point, I was disappointed.",0
No Negative very nice rooms clean and tidy Excellent staff had a wonderful stay there ,1
 not much the bed,1
"Got the room on Priceline for $-- and that's what my room is worth. Can hear the buses go by, construction work outside & shower is in dire need of repair.",0
No Negative The hotel is in excellent location very near the metro station Diagonal which is connected with 3 metro lines So it was easy to go everywhere fast The hotel was very clean and comfortable i liked very much that had option to make late check out because my flight was in night For sure i will choose it again ,1
 The first room we were put into had a strong smell of damp We complained and it was dealt with in an efficient manner staff giving us another room within a few hours  The hotel is close to train and bus services ,1
"Check in for me was a breeze, but an unhappy group before me had had its messages lost and it took them quite a while to get settled. Lobby is dark, dingy, and full of cheap art. Could be seen as festive if not for such gloominess otherwise (black rug--what were they thinking?). Total of -- watts (OK, maybe --) in room lamps which made reading impossible. Beds are old and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""queen"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was a full bed. No """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""guest services"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" guide in room--maybe because there were no guest services to be had? Pool not cleaned-spa with twigs and leaves. I liked the location, but think that unless I were paying less than $---night, I probably could get something nicer for just a few pennies more.",0
"Can't really complain for the price.
Very out dated hotel that is in desperate need of a make over.
Room smelt of mould, in fairness staff did offer - other rooms but they wernt much better. Should have security at night as very rough neighborhood, wouldn't recommend for families.
On last day staff where very rude, kept harassing me to check out even though I organized a late check out. They then said it will be an extra $- and and kept chasing it, sersiouly wtf",0

 Furnishings were a bit shabby and a very small room  Central location which was remarkably quiet ,0
 The facility is in bad shape Torn curtains holes in the carpet tiny room black water stain on the shower and stained tub cracked toilet seat The worst part was the poor and unreliable internet connection Pretty bad for a four star hotel The location is excellent,0
No Negative ATTENTION TO DETAIL QUAINT UNUSUAL FOR CITY CENTRE DIFFERENT FROM THE NORM IN BEAUTIFUL OLD BUILDING,1
 The room I stayed in the first night was ridiculously small located down in the basement without any Windows if I hadnt complained to the staff I probably would have been expected to stay in that room How the can expect people to pay for that room has got me beat  The position of the hotel was great ,0
No Negative The worst staff Absolutely arrogant from management to check in staff The rudest I have encounterd in my life Would never return,0

 After 5 nights in s hotel you generally get to know some of the staff or get some acknowledgement Not here Quite bland service Great location modern large hotel,1
 We booked for a king bed room however a twin room with two single beds was provided An immediate change of room could not be provided without paying extra to upgrade the room The room has funny smell which was not pleasant The house keeping staff was kind and helpful who combined the two single beds together to make a double bed However the overall experience was disappointing given the price we paid No Positive,0

 breakfast was poor No Positive,0
 Found it difficult to work the coffee machine in the room Great location and lovely staff Beds were comfy and nice spacious room ,1
 Very small rooms no room for even a chair Staff Breakfast Next to Underground Station,1
 Additional fees for the gym  Atmosphere and Quality good is very good,1
 A little draught from the windows but may be compensated by heating Convenient location close to metro station good breakfast helpful staff pleasant atmosphere classic music and interiors,1
 The hotel breakfast was an okay buffet style breakfast but not worth the 14 euros Instead walk about a block away to Brunch Cake for the best breakfast ever The hotel is surrounded by amazing restaurants that are like a block away enjoy  I loved my stay at Axel Barcelona And I can speak from my experience it is indeed heterofriendly As a solo female traveler I would highly recommend staying here I felt extremely comfortable and everyone staff and guests were extremely friendly I also feel like the hotel was in a great location in the city ,1
 the room unfortunately was way below my expectations considering the price and the star rating Wi Fi very bad the position of the Hotel is great and the staff very helpful and friendly,0
 Lacked cleanliness in the room Amenities not refilled When we arrived their was no soap in the dispensers but we brought our own thankfully The bed overlay pad was full of material knobs that could be felt through the flat sheet and the flat sheet pulled off during the night The pillows are lumpy and uncomfortable  The staff were friendly at the front desk ,0
 The room was poor and the breakfast was disgusting obviously cooked earlier and re heated The buffet breakfast was skimming in grease and cold Even though breakfast was included on both nights stay we had breakfast the second morning elsewhere  Staff very attentive especially Kieran who got us a taxi and carried our luggage a short walk to the road He is s credit to his profession and also a credit to the hotel,0
 None IT was a memorable stay Professional service great location clean and great breakfast,1
 It says that they offer A C but nothing was blowing out when we turned it on The Windows do not open so it gets super stuffy in the room No Positive,1
 Breakfast was basic but adequate Great location Spacious quiet and comfirtable room,1
 Nothing Location was perfect Staff were so very friendly Lovely atmosphere Would definitely return,1
 No mirror in the room only in the bathroom  Room really cosy and clean,1
 the attitude and responsibility of the staffs were totally disappointed Truly I never had an experience in other hotel before particular in big cities I cannot accept that customer was to be blame and the staffs responsed with an improper manner when they passed us wrong information on first hand  location is good,0
 The toilet room has no door  Very clean ,0
"I appreciate the concept of this hotel and thought the modern twist on things was fun. It wasn't very clean though and they didn't clean once while we were there (- nights). We splurged for the terrace that came with a jacuzzi and when we got in the room we found out that the jacuzzi wouldn't be turned on and filled with water until next month. Little disappointing. The club that the lobby floor is on transforms into a night club that's certainly fun while your there but didn't expect to still be able to hear the music when I got to my room, four floors up. Overall, great location and decent price but I wouldn't go back.",0

 very very unfriendly and impatiently woman staff at reception The air conditioner dose not work well feel cold at night the worst experience during this trip The price is too high for such service WONT recommend this hotel to anyone too bad nothing,0
No Negative Wonderfully welcoming and helpful reception staff The best I have experienced in 10 years of visiting many hotels Excellent breakfast with new additions each day to the buffet ,1
 Reception Staff could be friendlier Breakfast was good,1
 I really can t say that any one issue stands out so negatively since the hotel is quite attractive and very well managed  We were especially impressed not just with the little swimming pool on the rooftop but also with the well heated Sauna next to it ,1
 The new rooms have a rather small bathroom which is OK but it is also a wet room and the design means that once the shower has been used you cannot revisit without getting your feet wet and when changing any clothes that touch the floor become wet a fundamental design flaw in my opinion No Positive,0
 N a N a,0
 There was no BBC news channel other than French spoken channel We reported to the staff that told us the engineer had checked our room We couldn t get BBC channel in our room because the location of our room The staff didn t think an alternative way to solve the problem which I found slightly disappointed I do stay in the Paris for holiday watching TV isn t a big issue however I do like to know what s going on in the world early in the morning before I get out of the door Especially all the disasters have happened in Paris recently I do recommend the hotel to solve the TV problem out for foreign travellers  The location is brilliant ,0
"This is an oddly located, run down Motel, not worthy of the Marriott brand. 
The only tiny saviour was B'Fast was OK.
Check-in from almost -- hours travelling was less than graceful. Bathroom old and musty with black mould and lime scale stacked taps.
Pillows were stained, old and greasy. They made me wretch.
Bitten by bugs-fleas-ticks just for good measure.
one coffee sachet.
Noisy main route outside and bloomin freezin or boiling....One of the worst hotels I had ever stayed in.",0
No Negative Avoid the quaint Victorian places they are not charming just cramped often dirty and lacking any comforts The Doubletree Ealing was easy to get to on the Tube 1 5 minute walk from Ealing Common Station The bus stop was directly across the street The room was great comfortable beds quality bedding and towels fast internet free seemed to have plenty of parking and the complimentary cookies tasty I booked the night before my stay and got a great rate 135 BP,1
"The hotel is okay, but the location is great! Hotel rooms are a little small and you can hear the TV in the next room, but they are clean. My son and I stayed in a two double bed room on the fifth floor. The view was fine, looks like you can upgrade for $- more for a better view.
The pool is outside and very nice (two life guards on duty). The workout room is unreal for a hotel. I was pretty impressed. Staff is very friendly.
Okay, back to the location. The Metro is a couple of blocks away (Dupont Circle). You can get to anything from there. The Zoo is exactly -.-- miles away (my son and I ran there, stayed a few hours and then ran back). There are restaurants and lots of shops in both directions. Check out Flippin Pizza and Larry's Ice Cream.",1
 Artisan bar was so busy we weren t able to get a table Fabulous service ,1

 The bathroom is small and not isolated from the room glass door There was a lot of noise from the above room bad isolation  Excellent Location and brekefast,1
No Negative Good choice of continental breakfast plenty of seating rare queues Though in the basement the room is air conditioned light and with an airy feel Public rooms and corridors are well proportioned and quiet The restaurant caters for most tastes and pockets The Bar is well stocked the wine list is adventurous and the wine well kept Bedrooms and bathrooms are spotless and generally well appointed The beds are comfortable yet supportive Given the general warmth of the building few guests should need more than the quilt provided Guests have self control of air conditioning and central heating Though window openings are restricted for safety reasons the available air flow is adequate ,1
 I asked for a canal view and was only told at check in that it was not possible why hotels do not have the courtesy to let you know you cant have what you asked so you can decide to book elsewhere felt I had been tricked by the hotel to pay for a room with a view on the scaffolding on the other side of the street Check in took 2 people and was very chaotic They charge you potential expenses in advance and reimburse you when you check out meaning they use your money while you are staying with them  location was perfect for visiting Camden Market,0
No Negative Friendly stuff understanding the problem the guests and solve it ,1
 The hotel is showing signs of wear Our sink was very unpleasant the window nets too We were disappointed to have no toiletries this time and believe they were there on our last visit  Breakfast and coffee are excellent as are the staff Proximity to Gare du Nord Quiet ,0
 The hotel is let down by the restaurant which is not typical of a HDV Staff seemed to be rushing around but not actually doing anything Several hot evening meals had to go back as they were cold this was rectified with alternatives quickly Service was also slow We all got the impression that the comments we were making were not unusual as they were greated with apathy Breakfast was also cold and had to be sent back  On the plus side the bedroom was immaculate and the team all friendly and very welcoming ,1
No Negative Modern and functional,0
No Negative Lovely comfortable room very professional friendly staff,1
 Restaurant was closed and they didn t informed me when I did the reservation Due to the fact that good food in Amsterdam is a issue it was a problem that restaurant was closed No facilities as spa gym etc  Good location Nice and clean room Breakfast has menu it s a different concept Breakfast area and employees in breakfast were friendly and polite Coffee and tea in the room ,1

 Ignored during check in for a little too long dirty carpets kind of a dark cave like interior very small room with slanted ceiling expensive charged 12 euros for crappy continental breakfast cereal yogurt pastries instead of including it like all other hotels in Europe  The bed was very comfortable ,0
 The hotel d cor feels tired and the updated rooms miss the luxury mark you would expect of a four star hotel in Mayfair The road was also incredibly noisy being woken up at 6am to workmen outside  The location of the hotel was ideal with shops bars restaurants parks and museums just a few minutes walk away ,0

 The decor The location,0
 The reception did feel a bit regimented A credit card deposit which takes 3 days to be cleared when there was no mini bar restaurent and breakfast was included seemed excessive It would also be better having a key card rather than having to drop off and collect keys  The hotel was clean The breakfast included in the price was plentiful and although the reception was a bit fussy in needing a refundable credit card deposit staff were friendly ,1
 No hot water window at a construction place elevator didn t work room smells like sigaret bathroom for handicapped people wasn t comfortableNo Positive,0

 No My flight was arrived in the early morning and I was at hotel around 9am The staff said the room is ready and let me check in room rightaway It helps a lot for me and husband to settle down and refreshed before going out for sight seeing Also it located near both train station and Metro which is very convenient I have wonderful experience during the stay and recommend to all type of travelers ,1
 Parking fees were horific 55 euro per day but then if your dumb enought to take a car into central Amsterdam you deserve it Hotel staff were very helpful and considearte especially Louis,1
 There should be some sitting area in the reception lobby where guests can sit and you should give an option of orthopaedic mattresses for elderly people or whosoever may desire for longer stay in the hotel The house keeping service needs improvement The outside of the building needs a makeover primarily painting to make the property look attractive  The dining area looks elegant and the service is very good The reception staff is polite and efficient ,1

 Everything check my complaint on social media Instagram sasthe3rd Nothing but the drinks they served behind the bar,0
 The swimming pool is quite good but just to say something the lighting and the ceiling could be improved a bit  The room has got a nice modern design it was so cozy clean and confortable Really good bathroom with both bath and shower and a separate toilet Perfect for a trip to Amsterdam I would repeat no doubt There is a coffe machine and a kettle to have coffee or tea in the room itself Ironing facilities and even an umbrella just in case Perfect ,1
 Free coffee or tea outside of breakfast hours would have been nice  Breakfast had a lot of variety and included both hot and cold items Easy tram ride to Central station and cruise ship port Convenient that hotel sold tram pass ,1
 This place is awful The carpet was about 30 years old with stains everywhere the walls were paper thin to hear my neighbors having sex The hotel was unable to produce a receipt and said the had to email it but I have yet to receive  Nothing,0
No Negative quiet clean friendly staff,1
 It is not nice that slippers are only for executive rooms I think slippers are not executive thing Room was cold when we entered I expected the room to be warm for winter Cups and spoons at the room was not clean  Good location Grand Boulevards metro station is in front of the hotel entrance Friendly staff Nice to have kettle in the room ,0
 Shower Formation Too many confusing knobby Shower head was none functional Our sink clogged often All was ok For money ,0
 The price of breakfast seemed very high for what was included Drinks at the bar were also super expensive as compared to other places nearby  Fantastic hotel right in City Center The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly Appreciated the free wifi complimentary bottles of water and the fitness center ,1
 Pillows too thick and uncomfortable good bed,0
 We d asked for milk for the room which didn t come but this was a very minor problem We were upgraded to a premium executive room as their Guest of the Day and we had a free full breakfast each to go with it Couldn t fault the hotel at all ,1
 Even if they provided mefor free the paid version of Wi fi which is supposed to be somewhat fast it was still slow  The location and the courtesy of all personnel ,1
 Thought the mini bar was very expensive My husband loved all the ipad controls in the room the bed was really comfy,1
 Nothing Very very minor niggle is the sliding door on the shower was quite stiff But that s grasping at straws  Staff are incredibly friendly and facilities are great including leisure and fitness suite Super location being right beside Lambeth North tube station and the many great things London South Bank has to offer ,1
 The small bed in the double rooms The was so small to fit two The location and the peaceful and quite lobby and location,1
 Priset standart for en 4 hotel,1
 breakfast is poor with a very small food selection and almost no hot food choices check in takes AGES we specifically asked for separate beds upon booking and afterwards during check in yet we got a room with a double bed which was inconvenient given we were travelling with a friend When we called reception to clarify the answer was these are two separate beds they are just together D needless to say the beds could not be separated overall definitely not a 4 European hotel 3 max perfect location just off Ramblas and Gothic quarter with a metro stop 2 mins away,1
 some members of the reception staff could be much more consumer oriented and professional the breakfast is quite good but in most of the other Austria Trend hotels clearly better ,0
 The Restaurant had run out of key ingredient from their limited menu The waitress lied about the sauce on the brisket and the customer service right up to duty manager was deplorable and insulting Having stayed in other DoubleTrees and The Hiltonsurrounding I was horrified The room was not made up and after some hours trying to locate anyone to help I was told I would have to stand there or it would not be done The step into the bathroom has a sign but is still missable owing to the tiling  We were thankful the Blacksmith was to hand The hosts and hospitality should train those at The Hotel They were so good we returned for a family mealife later in the week ,0
 The fridge did not seem to work  Had a comfortable and relaxing stay The hotel is well suited for a weekend trip Close enough to the strict center to quickly reach all places ,1
 Corridor too hot not air conditioned Garden a bit tired Comfy bed Nice rooms Gorgeous entrance Safe location,1
 Had breakfest only one morning only one of us and was charged for several days Not right  Everone was very nice and helpfull made our stay very nice ,1

 I was charged with breakfasts that I d never taken I got the refund and everything was all right after all though it wasn t so nice  staff helpful ,1

 Kettle in room but this was not a big issue Staff were so friendly and helpful can not recomend highly enough well well worth a visit,1
"Very good location for Fisherman's Wharf and Pier --.
Pretty much what you'd expect for a Holiday Inn Express. Our room was on the ground floor and it was noisy from traffic late into the evening - early morning so try and get a room on a higher floor. 
One of the 'selling points' was that breakfast was incuded but it really wasn't that great. The Holiday Inn next door looked a lot smarter and was the same price at the time but didn't include breakfast. On balance I'd go for that one as there are loads of places to eat nearby.
One other thing...the towels! There were - of us but we were only ever given - towels and had to ask for a -th towel every day.",0
 The hotel is currently undergoing renovation Having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind What we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin I have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice How Best Weston had the nerve to charge for this I ll never know I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and I most certainly won t be staying there again Nothing The pictures on the website did not reflect the actual hotel,0

 there was a really strange noise going on for the whole night which was pretty loud I can still hear it even with my ear plugs on and the shower has broken down  perfect location,0
 Breakfast could of been better for the price Not very quick on the replenishment hence the reason we only ate there once  We loved how close the hotel was to the metro Very easy a great little bakery down the road too Bonus ,1
 This hotel states they have plenty of free parking It s a lie To add insult when showing the reference to their quote on booking com l was told and l quote free parking is free subject to availability However as we ve sold the parking rights to an outside contractor there is no free parking available I am a frequent business traveller and never normally write reviews However l promised the receptionist l would make a point of leaving one for this stay so here you have it Oh whilst l m writing your internet is also about as good as your customer service skills No Positive,0

 The rooms are surprisingly small and the gym has only a few pieces of equipment which disappointed my husband  The Banke is a beautiful hotel and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful The added extra are lovely pick and mix sweets in reception etc We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and were treated to champagne which was lovely The rooms were immaculately cleaned every day as well as a daily turndown service My husband and I were able to walk to all the major tourists sites from the hotel though we did clock up a lot of miles We would definitely stay there again,1
 Breakfast Place,0
 The comfort of the bed This is the only point which pushed me to rate lower Too soft Everything in the bed was too soft Soft mattress very soft quite thin pillow bad sleep Another point you come to the doors but they don t open automatically The frontier has to push the button Sometimes they go away you stay and wait One day we were waiting some minutes looking through the windows inside and that was ab 10 p m  Great location in El Born we absolutely love this part of Barcelona Everything is different here nice bars restaurants mostly innovative cuisine nice shops spirit St Catherina market just 10 min walk away Nice part just across the street next to Zoo Good breakfast nothing special but fairly good everything fresh friendly stuff Good WiFi,1
 Nothing  Every thing The hotel is very luxury They upgraded our room to sweet with a very nice service The location is next to marble arch The stuff are very lovely and everything is perfect they deserve 7 stars not only 5 ,1
"really nice staff, great location and the large room made luxe a nice retreat after a long business meeting.",1
"This hotel provides a GREAT location - very quiet - the landscaping around the pool is very nice. The front desk was average at check in and while they accomadated me in my arrival time ( -:--PM ) they made sure I knew that check is was not until -:--PM and they were doing me a favour by getting me in earlier. WELL THANKS - I guess.....
The rooms are in need of a full update - peeling paint, missing fixtures, dim lighting. The linens in the room need to be changed and updated as they have seen their better days.
The Breakfast area was very nice, the breakfast was very good ( need a second waffle maker ), the staff was friendly in the morning and check out was easy",0
 Too far away from Milan centre very rude male bartenders slow service no kitchen equipment in apartment no kettle no iron or ironing board All requests were dealt with incredibly slowly  Modern hotel with elegant interior design Very helpful female reception staff,0
"While the room was very small, and did appear a bit dingy, it was not dirty or unpleasant. The view of times square was amazing and the location is perfect if you are taking in a Broadway show. I recommend this hotel highly if you want a great location but not if you want all the frills of a luxury hotel.",0

"We got a good deal at this hotel for - nights. The location is good but not great. Tropical landscaping was enjoyable. The restaurant's food was ok, happy hour is ---pm. We were a bit disappointed with the room itself, the bathroom needed major upgrades. Would not pay full price for a room at this hotel.",0
 breakfast is very limited and repeated there was maintenance going on in my floor infront of my room it was annoying walls are thin you can hear everything OVERPRICED  Location is good everything is close by on foot the rooms are modern clean and have a nice view staff is friendly ,1
 The rooms need painting and renovating there were stains on the walls and we also had a spiders web with files behind the curtains The bathroom door on the inside at the bottom was a mess Also in the room is a kitchen that takes up quite a lot of space You can t make a hot drink as there are no cups or a kettle just glasses and a pan but it does have a decent sized fridge When you walk in and out of the hotel you get hit by a blanket of cigarette smoke as this is where all the smokers congregate sitting outside it s terrible  The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful The breakfast was ok ,0
No Negative Very expensive not even a bottle of water available to drink poor service at breakfast buffet the bell boy Ahmed was very helpful and provided better service than the hotel staff Location was good but not worth the money we paid ,0
 the breakfast area was small and didnt have much variety for 15 Bedroom came with a coffee machine including refills of different strengths etc the tv had lots of english speaking channels and the bathroom looked fantastic especially the powerful shower ,1
"There are lots of plusses and minuses about this hotel, but despite the thin walls (and hotel is sometimes thinly staffed) I'm sure I will be back again. This is my second stay, both trips included being shuttled by hotel van to nearby music venues and this service was timely friendly and efficient. You are on your own after --pm as the bar restaurant and shuttle stop at this time. The size of the rooms vary a LOT, it might be wise to inquire about this as our room this time was way smaller than last time. I like the atmosphere; not a snob joint like so many downtown hotels. I found the bar and menu surprisingly reasonable for Dallas. There was a greeter when we came back from a club about midnight inquiring about our evening and getting back to the hotel without them. Cute.",1

 The room could have a better choice of TV channels for foreign guests as we only had BBC world news for British travellers It would also benefit from a mini fridge in room to keep cool small bottles of water or cans of soda We also found it impossible to find ice in or around the hotel to take to our room and enjoy a chilled bottle of champagne on the balcony and therefore had to gulp it down quickly due to the heatwave  The bed was very comfortable We stayed in room 801 which had a view although limited of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame It was very hot during our stay and the air conditioning worked perfectly We would recommend this hotel to others but as space inside the room is limited we would advise no large suitcase or holdalls ,1
"We requested a nonsmoking room, but it still smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and had a cigarette burn on the bed blanket. The walls were thin--we could clearly hear the conversation going on in the next room. The breakfast was terrible--stale bagels, powdery eggs, etc. We booked here because there supposedly was refrigerators and microwaves in the rooms, but there was neither in our room. We also were unable to get a king size bed. Having said all of that, the location was convenient and the cleanliness was OK, and there was no problem with the service.",0
 Having the cleaner knocking on the door at 8am asking what time we were leaving check out was noon  The location and entertainment in this area ,0

"Not a bad hotel. The main entrance was nice and well attended by staff, but the garage entrance was vacant and dirty. Room (standard queen on --th) was decent size, not large by any means, with good view of stadiums (view of harbor from other side of hotel). Room had a pass through door to the next room and was transparent to sound. Could hear everything next door. Not good it you are a light sleeper. Staff was courteous and efficient. Great location.",0

 rude service in restaurant doesn t cater for kids odd pool opening closing times lovely rooms,0
 Gym and pool modest reasonable rather than wow Would expect two bottles of complementary water in a 4 hotel rather than none  Slick modern executive room Very quiet excellent sleep Super WiFi Read a few complaints about breakfast before booking but actually it was excellent They even had a gluten free section Great ,1

 Broken glass in the cupboard above the sink curtain puller came off in my hands took 20 mins to check in despite being the only people in the lobby air conditioning poor at best  Good sized room comfy bed,0

 This hotel is for no reason a 4 star hotel The room was very small one double bed could hardly fit in The bathroom was very small as well especially the shower The check in was very bureaucratic you need to fill in a whole form with personal details The internet was slow The place for breakfast is on the basement and seems like a cave  Tle location was the relevant advantage The breakfast was also decent and the bed comfortable enough ,0
 There ways in the treat the guestNo Positive,0
 This is not actually a hotel This is just a place for 1 night and no more A dirty room with a lot of broken things and spots everywhere The lift was out of work An awful experience  The staff was polite and helpfull ,0
 I really don t believe this is a 4Star hotel it s like 2Star We very go back there No Positive,0

"Stayed here with a friend for a couple of days and had a more then great stay.
We picked this hotel cause we wanted a good Hotel in a good central location and it was everything we expected it to be.
The Hotel has a great allure, and a wonderful huge lobby with nice staff.
The rooms were large, nicely decorated, really good beds and always clean.
The Hotel's location is probably one of the strongest arguments to pick this hotel, cause its right where you want to be and its hooked to Grand Central Station, so if you wanna get some food or drinks its yours to catch (unless you want to order expensive roomservice),
If im going to visite New York again i will definitly book this hotel again.",1
 After I opened the door of the room I had to go down the stairs It was an inconvenience to carry my bags but exercise The ceiling was high and I could see the piIlars and the roof on the bed It was somewhat cold at night I thought the insulation was not good A heater and warm water in the bathtub were helpful  Just 1 tram stop distance from the central station or walk Just opposite the police station Good place to begin the tour Taxi fare from Schiphol airport about 50 55 euro my case I arrived in the late evening Nice breakfast Kind staff Quiet atmosphere Good fast WiFi open ,1
 Hotel rooms were more worn out than expected water damage visible to ceiling bathroom had nicks and scratches that could have been easily repaired No one answered when calling front desk guest services Our room was very warm and we had to go down to front desk to talk to anyone Can not recommend this hotel  Location is great if you want to be near Tower Bridge and the Tower ,0
We arrived on a Friday Night and there were several drunk college age students milling around. It didn't seem safe and both my son and I did not have a good night's sleep. The desk clerk didn't seem quite right either. Moved to another hotel the next day. The location is very pretty which is the only good thing I have to say but the area is very shady at night.,0
 I didn t have a proper window in my room and so had no natural daylight for my whole stay Rather depressing  The location was excellent for London Olympia exhibition hall ,0
 A little cleaner in the Brasserie especially around bottom of window frames food debris etc  Good food both at lunch and for breakfast ,1
 Everything It is just a truly awful hotel and I will never stay here again Avoid at all costs Plenty of nicer hotels to choose from in London  Nothing Vile rude staff Loud rooms Never again,0
No Negative lovely clean rooms and bathrooms breakfast also very nice Staff very polite and helpful,1
 nothing the hotel was beautifully appointed the staff were excellent and the manager was always around to ask if things were going well we really felt at home they could not do enough for us,1
 Twin room could have been a bit bigger and the Pillows could have been better  Breakfast was nice staff were very friendly ,1
 Other rooms being cleaned without consideration to other guests sleeping Breakfast was very poor Long queues and the worst coffee machine ever invented We walked straight out and had our breakfasts elsewhere New Years morning there was a hooker in the lift would you believe  Good bar friendly staff comfortable room ,0
No Negative Great location attentive staff clean and comfortable room Secure overnight parking nearby saves lugging bags on the underground Excellent ,1
 If possible I would avoid breakfast Organised chaos Too many members of staff floating around serving coffee Just let hotel guests get their own Buffet area is too small for the number of guests so queues form  Highly recommend this hotel Absolutely brilliant location with Warren Street tube station 30 seconds walk away and Kings Cross Station within walking distance My girlfriend and I received a free room upgrade upon arrival and a fresh fruit platter which was a nice touch Room was a decent size for a London hotel Very clean Spotless bathroom with soaps shampoo and conditioner Room was very quiet overlooking the rear of the hotel ,1
 Location is a little bit out and the air con makes a noise all night Room is great and facilities are lovely,1
 Breakfast was awful and a waste of money Room was too small and the bathroom was ridiculous I have seen bigger match boxes Some staff were nice and did try hard It I feel that a lot of the staff lacked the proper training,0
 I liked everything  Location amazing The hotel is great clean comfortable wifi decent breakfast but I prefer go across the street and get health food a pret a la mange Everything was excellent and great great value ,1
"Stayed at Wyndham in lieu of the hotel where my meeting was held, because it was much more affordable. And just as nice too, at less than half the price. This was Sunday evening, February --, ----.
Shuttle was available to local conference (major industry event), and to-from airport. Airport was only about a mile away too, so that was easy too.
Hotel was clean, bar & restaurant onsite, with room service too.
Rooms clean, bathroom, ameneties, everything clean, working and in order. Hookup for high speed connection to your computer. 
I would stay here again.",1
 tv signal failed several times friendly service and great bathroom,1

 Noisy teenagers football training sat in corridor making a lot of noise Big concern about room cleaning My cups weren t washed one still had tea in it from previous day On arrival I noticed the hand towel had an unpleasant stain and a hole so I left it in the bath it wasn t replaced and should not have been in a room to start with This is NOT a 4 hotel  The location was convenient for my business trip,0
 The fridge didn t work  everything ,0
 Check in was time consuming The three of us had to provide e mail addresses and signatures The room didn t have all the items for 3 people even though it was a 3 bedded room The hotel was quite noisy at night  Good location comfortable warm room ,1
 During our first evening at the hotel while having dinner at the pizzaria a restaurant part of the hotel we saw a mouse walking the room Of course we didn t have any other meal in the hotel Brittania Hotels never again No Positive,0
"Just felt decieved from the description. You can TECHNICALLY see Westlake from an angle, over some buildings in one window, but not really 'a view'. Elevator issues, weird and rusty basement door with bike lock is kind of annoying for coming and going. Also annoying sound from elevator room all night, creey  reppetive circus music from the I think lottery place next door all day. Was kind of annoyed when I was sleeping and gotta knock on the door to show my room while I was in it. Not a terrible place in another context but not what I expected from ad. It's not some awesome Lakeside superhost place like I expected, and it wasn't cheap. Also xonfused as it's advertised as homestay/airbnb/hotel/apartment/etc. It's not a homestay. It's a 2 star hotel room with a kitchenette.",0
 For a Hilton hotel and the price paid hotel lacked shine Rooms were dated Ive stayed in premier inn hotels with rooms with a sharper feel Also renovation was going on so had intermittant drilling and dusty lift lobby area Nice enough to stay but I expected more with Hilton and for the price paid Unfortunately I dont think ill be staying here again  Staff were friendly and polite Tasty and good selection at breakfast ,0
 In house menu could be expanded although still very delicious burgers  I loved the executive suite and the connected garden No words to describe the friendliness of the amazing staff,1
 Stuart at front desk was very rude and discreminationg  Location is perfect and the price ,0
"After reading all the reveiws, I think my expectations were set to high. This is a nice budget hotel, but # - on Trip Advisor? Really? We stayed on our way to a cruise ship departure in Galveston and found the hotel to be good value for the money and that's all I can really say about it.",0
 we have 3 single bed instate 1 single and 1 double the staff is very rough no nice at all and i think because them have problem with italian guy because after speak with a lot people italian them say to me over there receive the same treatment from other guys from this place the restaurant is expansive is well water you must pay for park and is expansive is well the second day after the day before order dinner with room service who clean the room don t collect back the dirty dishes but leave all in the room  i like about this hotel just the breakfast and the bathroom inside room ,0

No Negative Liked everything specially Miss Robyca she was so welcoming,1
 This is definitely not a four star hotel according to European standard No Positive,0
 One of the waiters in the restaurant in the evenings seemed deliberately slow ignoring me and spending time instead sorting receipts and paperwork Although there were very few customers I had to make an effort to gain his attention He was curt and did not seem to be enjoying his work  Convenient location for public transport Well trained efficient polite staff Comfortable room Good shower Nice food and good beer in restaurant Very good choice at breakfast used dishes cleared away and tables reset quickly buffet replenished promptly ,1
 The executive room is very small and I believe that the standard room is even smaller It is not worth for the high rate of the room No Positive,0
 Too hot in the room no wi fi was available in a tiny room  Good location,0
 No idea I liked everything about this hotel  The location is great very decent area less than 1 mile from the Central Station and 2 subway stops or walking distance to the Cathedral The subway stop is right around the corner and the tram stop a few meters from the hotel Great shopping area also The room has plenty of space and everything you need it is clean and nicely furnished A mini bar and tea coffee facilities are also in the room Wi fi works fine Breakfast suits everyone as it has a lot of choices The stuff helps you at all times I will certainly book this hotel next time I come to Milan ,1
 There was no electricity for long time and I can t use elevator was problems at that time because I had operation in my knee Also most of time no WI FI in my room One morning even there was elect but no hot water  I like only location Other than this I had very very bad experience Never recommend this hotel to any one,0

 room was tiny and lacked basic hotel amenities like a hot water kettle tea slippers etc  the old world feel of the hotel very nice and charming great location in marylebone,1

 way too expensive for what you get common problem for Amsterdam Check in at 3pm check out before 12am so you pay a lot for less than 24h  easy to get around the city location is good clean and good size rooms,0

"I'm an east coaster who looked at every place in the westlake-university area for a room, for a single night. All were booked-up besides the Four Seasons. The price they quoted me on the phone was about $-- less than the discount sites listed it for online. 
The room was large, had a great view, big tv, tv in the mirror in the bathroom, and a garden tub a family could swim in. However, fondle the minibar, or eat a candy bar from the snack drawer and it'll cost your your first born child...
Service was completely the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how can we help you"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mentality, in a sincere form. The entire staff was warm and welcoming. 
I would definately stay there again and I would recommend it to anybody",1
 The rooms are a bit aged and need renovation Location Good wifi Polite staff,1
 First room offered was in basement with no natural light Second room had a window but only later realised the device in the middle of the floor with a vent pipe going across to the window was a fixture and meant to provide air conditioning It did cool the room but the noise was a health hazard Impossible to hear ourselves speak so we cooked instead There was obviously one in the next room too noise was terrible Room a bit shabby and could do with redecoration  Good location for museums and Royal Albert Hall Staff polite and helpful ,0
 The room had old furniture very dirty curtains and tired as well the breakfast wasnt fresh the overall building needs renovation not all the staff was helpful  The location was great ,0

 Extreme lack of lightly in areas painted completely black Very dangerous Classic example of trendy design over basic function Trendy certainly user friendly not really Lack of adequate computer and printing facilities Having to balance a small chained up laptop on ones knee while hunched on a small stool is hardly appropriate for serious computer access This precluded completion of some important work related tasks Corridors and stairwells dark which would create significant problems for persons with disabilities or poor eyesight  Location breakfast and concierge,0
 Room structure bathroom door in front of window it makes you feeling you are outside Difficult to be two adults in this bedroom Bed in front of windows you still feel outside not enough light near mirror in bathroom Windows Stores far from your arms No light nearby mirror to make up or shaving even next to the closet Bed too hard But we asked for solution and they found one Stairs are not heated you feel cold and outside before arriving to the lift Very cold each morning to pass through the way in to go to the breakfast room  The sightseeing from the bedroom Nespresso in bedroom The hall The location near museum quartier Kindness of staff Everything looks brand new ,1
"Very good location, -- minutes walk to Times Square, many restaurants nearby...
Staff need to be a bit polite but it seems it's a New York thing to be rude may be. I have travelled to the West Coast so many times, and I have always found them so polite and friendly, it's a different world out here.
Rooms are very small for an Intercontinental, we can compare them to the Holiday Inn Expresses in UK, which is part of the same chain of the IHG Group.
No Buffet breakfast, limited choice for food.",0

No Negative Fantastic location Near to Hyde Park and 2 different tube stations Great service ,1
 Blocked twice total charge on my card and then wanted 50 pounds deposit still Have not got it back even though room was left perfect very bad experience and nobody to be held responsible This hotel not worth the hassle and I organise trips regularly will tell people to avoid it still waiting on my 50 poundsNo Positive,0
 The staff at reception was rude and wasn t informative or helpful Breakfast was awful there was no variety and you have to get your own table so you will be walking around looking for a table making sure no one has taken it who are getting their food We hardly ate anything  I love the location of the hotel,0
 given the four star rating we were disappointed with the lack of coffee making facilities in the room or ability to obtain a hot drink prior to the breakfast area being opened We were also a little taken aback by the attitude of one particular staff member on the front desk as we had not run into this type of attitude before when we have been travelling It is a shame as the rest of the staff were extremely professional and it has coloured our view of the hotel  The bed was extremely comfortable,0
 VERY small room expensive for what you get one pillow no top sheet just the comforter no tissues shower water gets area in front of sink pretty wet AC fan were weak very funky layout don t expect a traditional hotel hard to find reception area on fourth floor internet was spotty would not recommend  Pretty decent location for walkers room was clean fresh towels everyday would ve been nice to know beforehand that pop beer in frig were free I didn t enjoy them because I thought they cost extra ,0

No Negative One of the best hotels I have ever stayed Perfect in everything ,1
 no cosmetic in the room no bathrobe to late cleaning of the room too expensive breakfest place by Rambla design hotel bar facility with piano player good price personal Hana in Bar bellboy,0
 Beds could be more comfortable Find it peculiar that a choice of whether to have breakfast from one day where it costs 19 to the following day where it costs 28 No mention of wifi whether it was free or not and how to access it Building is dated from the outside with a modern interior  Location is ideal for visiting the Westfield Shopping Centre or Kensington itself,0
"We stayed - night here, waiting for an onward flight. The room was clean, but somewhat old and it was separated from the next room only with a locked wooden door, which was a bit creepy and you could also hear everything that was being said in the next room. Minibar in the room, but nothing in it.
Apart from that, the beds were nice and the staff were friendly, so it's not a bad choice for a stopover.
I would NOT recommend the hotel restaurant for dinner, it was expensive and the food was horrible! But the breakfast buffet was surprisingly good, we couldn't believe it was the same restaurant as the night before.",0
 The room especially the bathroom was very small The room wasnt exactly ready when we arrived and had to wait a while there was no usual upgrade despite being Marriott member  The breakfast buffet was excellent with a good choice The staff on the door and concierge were very helpful Because we had no upgrade and were not happy with such a small room the receptionist offered complimentary breakfast which had not been included in the rate ,0

 The staffs are not efficient its our turn to check in but the girl asked us to wait for a short while and we waited at least 30 mins for her to come back Her colleagues saw us waiting but no one offers help all they said is please wait  Good location Although it s not in the central but it s very easy to get around via Tram ,0
 The hotel was absolutely spotless the room was very spacious and up to date I would recommend this hotel to anyone  The hotel was lovely and the staff where very pleasant and friendly ,1

 Despite sound proofing it sounded as if we were in the Metro Room 101 incredibly grumpy check out guy got really huffy because my card had somehow been blocked after visiting La Pedrera and I needed to contact my bank They suggested he call Visa International but he got really impatient and didn t want to Although the hotel is located in popular part of town it is very noisy generally traffic noise Pillows rather solid  Clean gym large shower ,0

"I normally stay at this hotel for pleasure, but this trip was business related. I was genuinely pleased that the service for business travelers is as personal, warm and genuine as when my husband and I travel for pleasure. I had the opportunity to experience the cuisine served during my business luncheons, receptions, breakfasts and dinners. Serving over --- attendees at once can be challenging, but the food was delicious, well presented, hot when appropriate and chilled when expected, the service was attentive, gracious, friendly and most important, I never felt like a number - I was always treated as an individual and a valued guest. I would highly recommend this hotel for pleasure and I hope my business travels take me to this property over and over again.",1

No parking spots -you'll have to park it on the street, and get up to move it (where please?) in the morning. And, oh please don't talk so loud when i am mistreatng you at check in- so i walked out . Warning to business travellers-they have limited parking-don't care if there's no space for you, and basically cater to one shot tourists visiting. Not for me.",0

 Room smelled like smokeNo Positive,1
 No staff apart from the bar all computer check in Nothing personal about this hotel complete buget with a 4 star price tag yet when you add on the cost of a mere cup of tea it soon adds upto 5 star prices People hanging around some asleep It was more like a student hostel As for the bedroom I do not appreciate brushing my teeth in the hallway I own bigger shoe boxes Squashed and claustrophobic is how myself and my husband felt Couldn t wait to leave Glad this trip was business not pleasure  Clean room comfortable bed Can t think of anything else good ,0

 The sound of slamming doors that wake you up  The design of the atmosphere unlikely hotel looking Great restaurants nearby ,0
 For a four star hotel we found this utterly unbeliavable this was a double room made in to a triple room three times we had to ask for extra pillows the walls where all marked the carpet had that many stains it was like a nineteen eighties room when we complained we where told that the receptionist was only an apprentice not a nice experience at allNo Positive,0
 I believe we got what we expected paid for The air conditioning in our room could have worked better though in all fairness it was exceptionally hot muggy outside when we stayed there  We had to catch an early train out of Montparnasse train station so the hotel s location was perfect I wouldn t necessarily stay in this area on a sightseeing trip to Paris but if you need to travel onwards by TGV to the West of France the location is top Rooms are standard not overly large but clean At EUR 15 breakfast isn t overpriced Relatively good selection of breakfast items including eggs ,1

 Room was in the basement and it was difficult to find Room was extremely small even though we d been told at check in that we had been upgraded Check in staff could have been much friendlier Menu at the restaurant does not make allowances for people with food intolerances so we had breakfast elsewhere Overall it was ok but I am not sure I d stay there again No Positive,0
"The rooms are too small. Front office staff is ok but not too friendly. If you don't want to spend much time in the hotel , then it is fine. 
I moved from Murray hill suites for - days stay in this hotel and their is no comparison, though the price was same. Murray hill suites on --th street is the best; more roomy and clean. Shared bathroom is another things you might want to consider before staying here. This is not a good hotel for couples or family. Students or singles may like it.",0
"My husband and I were treated very well by the staff at the W Union Square. Everyone was wonderful, but we tipped through the nose because we were on an expense account, so I am not sure that everyone would receive the same kindness. Our room was $--- per night, and I thought it was far less than a bargain. The room was nice and well-decorated, but it was not exciting or interesting. It paled in comparison to the Sofitel or the Rihga. The bar was very hip, and the restaurant was quite good-- it's a Todd English establishment. I don't have any real complaints, but I might not stay there again if I could find something more wonderful in the area.",1

 The location of my room 314 was horrible next to the service stairs and any noise woke me up the walls are soooo thin i could hear my neighbors all the time no mini fridge in the room and tiny room and closet the Halloween decor cheapened the over all feel of the hotel The bathroom was very nice and comfortable and the bed was also comfortable The bellboy was very polite and helpful and extremely professional i think he deserves a promotion ,0

 Little far from city center  Nice clean room comfy bed and peaceful surroundings,0
 The air conditioning was not working because they still consider the time to be winter but it was already warm weather and so at night it was very hot Also the menu for room service has only pizzas or baguettes no other options like salads or even desserts Also we left the room service dishes the night before and when we came back the day after they were still in the room even after cleaning was supposed to be done  The location is very good just a few minutes away from the main attractions The staff is very helpful available and they all speak many languages ,0
"I spent ten days at the Park Savoy in the beginning of May. Our room was small but very clean. The hotel is very well located. An excellent deal for the price. They even offer a very basic breakfast. The only thing my husband and I really didn't like was the fact they do not allow us to make phone calls even though we were willing to pay the price they'd charge us for it. 
I'd definitely stay there again.",1

 Couldn t accommodate enough table numbers for dinner No Positive,1
 The hotel was crowded It created uncomfortable atmosphere during breakfast The worst was to find additional cost tourist city tax 5 euro person It was written in small letters in the notes to the booking instead of being included in the price shown at the booking site When a tourist is tired and has limited time for a hotel selection such hidden cost are typically remain unnoticed This undermines the credibility of booking com  Good food for breakfast corresponding to 4 star hotel scrambled eggs with bacon selection of fruits that however quickly disappeared croissants Parking ,1

And, the foam pillows were HARD. Usually nice hotels have too soft pillows, but these were as close to rocks as I have ever tried to sleep upon. Finally got up & rolled up a towel to put up under my head. Called the next morning & they offered me feather pillows instead. 
Maybe the foam was just really old, but it was really hard; and I've slept on a lot of pillows in my life. Other than that, was nice surroundings, and the best pizza I've ever eaten was at the Italian pizza pallor down the street, next to the dry cleaners. Awesome cheese. Went back twice.",0

"We hand't intended staying in Dan Diego's Old Town, but it had the only accommodation available at our price. We had no complaints. Our room, though large, was a little dark, but maybe that's a good thing in summer. We didn't eat here, except for breakfast, which was OK. It has a lift, which was appreciated since there are many flights of stairs to get around. We were charged for parking, which I thought was a bit unusual in an out of town motel. Otherwise, no complaints",0
 Nothing Fab hotel in excellent location ,1
 mattresses not clean as we felt bugs scratch on legs whenever we sleep Breakfast was not ok as cooking smell was in the restaurant Location was suitable near the old town,0
 The wifi reception in our room was poor We only got reception while standing at the doorway  A good location near railway stationGaribaldi in a new area Modern room with a mini bar Breakfast selection was excellent with hot and cold breakfast options ,1
No Negative Clean rooms a bit small ,1
 Hotel was falling apart Furniture broken cupboard coming off in your hands lobby furniture was broken and had holes in the sofa A nightmare and most certainly not 4 stars  Great location ,0
 Rooms could look better Furniture such as chair and sofa looked shabby Didn t like the curtains Furnitures looked liked they were nt cleaned properly Less drinks in mini bar Breakfast too expensive and was not included in our superior room upgrade Would not rate this room hotel luxury  The AC was great and so was size of the room although it was an upgraded room which I requested and paid a very small fee Mini bar soft drinks free tea coffee facilities in room Bathroom was quite spacious Door of bathroom was fine Staff was friendly Lot of tv channels to flick through ,0
 exspensive breakfast high tea,1
 Aircon did not work day or night it was like a sauna room was so noisy you could not sleep Staff,0
No Negative Fantastic staff went out of their way to help We stayed in a junior suite which was fantastic with views of Casa Batllo from the balcony ,1
 No water So had to leave for meeting with out shower or wash The manager would not refund Said next time we could be upgraded We will see this has been promised before and not happened No Positive,0
 My credit card was charged additional 1 st night which still isn t cancelled 5 days at least  Nice breakfast free parking near public transport stops to get to Duomo,0
 Breakfast had limited food especially for a vegetarian like me  Nice Bed central location,1
 The hotel is not actually signposted from the main road and the main door is actually just off Bayswater Road so we ended up walking about 5 minutes past it Right opposite Hyde Park so you can enjoy a lovely walk through there close to 2 tube stations for different lines so very accessible,1
 The Cleanliness and creaking of the room floors Hotel needs a big renovation  The location,0
 Noisy rooms small Very basic breakfast poor Location,0
No Negative The room is specious very comfortable beds lots of storage space for suitcases and big closet The bathroom is a little small air conditioner is a little outdated and nosy but there is a window you can open for fresh air Overall very comfortable hotel with very nice staff and EXCELLENT location ,1
 What I didn t like people forgething that u treat them nice like no other tourist trying to give them presents and treat them friendlly but when they received orders not to smile anymore they changed their attitude in front of you  Doesn t a 4 star hotel have to have gym right Because here u had to walk 1km and pay even extra like 15euro feeling guilty if u ever forget the voucher What I loved the attitude of the manager that really knows how to treat the customers that stayed like 2 months in the hotel and telling them that booking com its the most important for them not the customer curious what kind of school she made U should give her a bonus and hire her at booking she is very loyal at everything means money ,0
"Its not a bad hotel, but I kinda expected a nicer room in a - star hotel. Maybe I am spoiled from staying in blinged out - star hotels in Vegas (serious bang for the buck there). The rooms are in serious need of an upgrade as they look very dated (popcorn ceilings and old carpet). There was also a musty kind of smell when we first walked into the room. That being said, the location is great, but there are many other hotels in the same area that are decent and probably cheaper (like Red Lion). I guess I can't complain too much since we got the room through priceline for $--- a night. We would probably try someplace else next time. However, if you can get a really good deal at the Westin, it is not a bad option.",0
No Negative Excellent location Clean and confortable bedroom Had a small terasse Perfect ,1
 Bit squashed at breakfast No Positive,1
 Room service food Rooms were nice and comfortable Good pool and spa Location brilliant,1
 Air conditioning in room didn t work and despite complaining wasn t fixed Carpets walls and public areas all felt dated and in need of refurbishment Was perhaps a 4 star hotel once but not anymore Location good close to le Marais and 3e arrondissement Fitness room not great but adequate,0
"The positives:
- Great location: Just north of Union Square; Just south of Chinatown, North Beach. At the intersection of two cable car lines and plenty of cabs in the area.
- Comfortable Beds
- Friendly staff
The negatives:
- Dated decor in the rooms, which were generally clean.
- Few amenities in the hotel, though they do have a small exercise room.
- Somewhat overpriced, with some better (but comparably priced) alternative hotels in the area.
- No viable breakfast options in the hotel, (the in-house restaurant charges a pretty penny for breakfast), but there are several restaurant alternatives a short walk from the hotel.",0
 15 min walk to central View from top floor,0
No Negative I left some lost property which was found and efficiently returned,1
 The shower screen inadequate causing mild flooding of bathroom floor  Easy to find good location central and close to public transport Not overly commercialised tourist district yet handily placed for all attractions and amenities ,1
 The room we were initially given was ridiculously small Superior Double room more like Closet However upon complaining to the Staff they did give us a different room the next day  Staff dealt with our room problem the next day without too much fuss ,0
 Everything see above I booked and paid for a double room it was actually a 3 4 bed the air conditioning didn t work there was no bar the carpet in communal areas was a trip hazard I chose this hotel for the pool it was disgusting I wasn t allowed to check in until 2 I left at 4 and stayed at the Radisson Blu I would like my money back,0
 None Location was good and the hotel is clean,1
 1 The hotel is very noisy inside with banging doors and loud staff activity 2 Bathroom not clean and poor 3 Reception area very slow with long queues even for simple questions 4 Need to queue for coffee at breakfast in a 4 star hotel  very little,0

 Room and especially ensuite was quite small No Positive,1
No Negative The location,1
No Negative Welcoming staff in the hotel didn t interact with them much as we were visiting Amsterdam central each day Had a spar nearby for snacks and drinks A few reaurants close as well Station in walking distance as well ,1
 Air con didn t appear to be working  The location is terrific Nearest tube is only a short walk away View from our room of the river and near landmarks was special Staff were very courteous Having left a personal item in the room on leaving it was returned to me in the mail shortly afterwards very efficient ,1
 Windows were unlocked in my room when I arrived Room took a while to heat up Free WiFi requires registration for each device Required to swipe keycard for elevator but not the stairs  Nice place clean and nice amenities Three electrical outlets at the desk Metro Underground Rail stations nearby and several food options I had a great stay and would stay there again ,1
 Didn t seem good value for money breakfast very expensive Good location,1
 The window in the room did not shut so the loud work noise across the road could be heard The room was tiny and the wardrobe was not big enough to hang your clothes  The location was really well situated for where we wanted to be Walking distance to main attractions such as the London eye The room was lovely and clean and the air con was a blessing as it was 28 degree outside ,0
 the customer service attutude the beds comfort wise awful the cost upmarket premier inn overall appalling going home,0
 Nothing really we really enjoyed our stay I noticed after we arrived that if we had booked direct with the hotel rather than through booking com we would have saved 30 on the hotel breakfast There s not a huge amount of early breakfast options nearby so this would be a good idea for a future stay  Lovely modern hotel with decent sized pool and great rooftop bar Very comfortable rooms extremely clean and well serviced The hotel is in a good location a little away from the hustle of las ramblas only a 10 15 minute walk from the nearest metro stations Great shopping nearby although it s not cheap ,1
 The bed was horrible worst night sleep  The style of the room ,0
 the cost was way too high for the location and general comfort No Positive,0
No Negative Fantastic location near to Beech Fully recommend ,1
 The room was more expensive than usual and was a weird corner room with a smaller bed than usual TV froze but was fixed eventually No handle on the ice bucket First time in 10 stays that it has not been excellent  good locationn,1
 Everything except the staff This is arguably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and especially for the price It is probably a 2 star not that I have ever stayed in one,0
 Unfortunately we found bed bugs in our room However the staff were very quick to get myself and my family out of our room immediately and into a different room Our trip and the hotel was amazing until this happened which is unfortunate  The staff was amazing They were very helpful and any problem you had they tried to do there best to fix it Breakfast was very good and we had a clean towels and beds were made everyday It is a bit of a walk to where everything is at but if you don t mind walking then it s not a problem ,0
 We arrived and were not given cookies as others have mentioned asked for a city or river view but got a wall and no fridge in room Also hall way smelt very weird like urine sometimes The view was amazing,0
No Negative Great hotel for cost ,1
 When we arrived they had given our room to someone else They said they had informed booking com to tell us but we never received this info  G,0
No Negative So very convenient for tube to explore London and also for transport to Heathrow Love the leafy Square Adore the breakfast and really loved our room on this visit Were spoilt to have a balcony Staff super helpful and breakfast is delicious ,1
 they did t change the towels the hole time i stayed the walls were a little bit dirty it is more like a 3 stars hotel close to the center tasty breakfast,0
 The tv wasn t working all night The bathroom,0
 The room was average for what you pay for it  The photos in the room information where incorrect and where changed after I had book the room Not happy ,0
No Negative Special breakfast so interesting delicious ,1
 Small just enough room to walk around the bed and a small desk Shower and toilet just enough room I was in the basement with windows leading to the street Single glass so you could hear a lot but it was a quiet road I had not trouble sleeping through it but if you are sensitive  Clean good bed and shower Free WiFi reasonable bandwidth enough to stream video Free minibar without a fridge but water and some nuts bars and muffins ,0
 Only one member of staff that we dealt with had English as their first language resulting in us struggling to understand them and them most certainly not understanding us We also found someone else s dried urine on the loo seat upon arrival We contacted housekeeping but they didn t understand us so it wasn t rectified until we had yo go to reception and complain  The view from our upgraded room was fab ,0
 Paint was flaking off the bathroom ceiling there were hairs in the towels that belonged to neither me nor my wife and there were no effective lighting for reading in bed other than the main light  The location was excellent ,0
 no lifts working during the morning scaffolding around the hotelNo Positive,0
 Over priced hotel but as much as any hotel in London  The location is very nice and the beds are very comfortable ,0
 room was dusty had a courtyard facing room which I expect would be noisy in summer if you wanted the window open There was a persistent knocking noise in the room like someone putting a cup down on a wooden surface Thought it was a noisy neighbour but it didn t stop for two days It wasn t constant just enough to be annoying  Pleasant staff breakfast wasn t bad bed comfy shower good easy to find ,0
 I hated the fact that when I booked the room I asked for early check in and when we got there we had to wait 1hr for the room to get clean and ready  The room service provided to us ,0
 All exec rooms were described to have a guaranteed view of tower bridge or the city as written in the guest information guide mine had a view of the rear courtyard Moved to a higher floor view still overlooking same area but better but room not as nice as original makes me wonder if it was an exec room i was moved to Apart from that would recommendNo Positive,1
 Noise is an issue here Noise from the outside the double glazed windows don t do a thing to soundproof noise from the corridor The worst part is that the bathroom door is only a smoked glass pane no auditory privacy whatsoever Awkward Also the standard room was a little small for two people The restaurant while it had received good reviews was always deserted and lonely felt dark and enclosed We ate elsewhere all three days  This hotel really is at the heart of the city tourist sights shopping wandering excellent restaurants all within mere steps of the front door ,1
"I am probably not going to stay here anymore even though the office I work at is right next door. The staff is nice but the hotel is just too old. They remodeled the lobby but didn't really care about their rooms. The drapes have stains, the shower curtain had mold, the internet is non existent (took me --min to get to this website, not kidding).. I changed my upcoming reservations and paying more to stay farther away. 
I have to say that the staff is really nice and caring though",0

 The rooms opposite the elevators are too loud Especially for premium rooms Gaps in the doors dont help  The bar staff were great alfonso espeically,1
 There is no service  Nothing Horrible service ,0
 Most people will be mmming and ahhhing about the location You can walk to the main train station in about 30 minutes The nearest metro station is about 15 minutes walk Line 5 which is the newest line and is on the same line as the San Siro For me location wasn t an issue  I arrived way earlier than check in started and was greeted by a very friendly woman at reception who managed to check me in and give me the keys straight away which was so welcome after a night s sleep at an airport The hotel is much bigger than I expected and everything was clean Breakfast was good and there is a supermarket just at the end of the same street as the hotel ,1

 this hotel is not 4 star the carpet in bedroom was thread bare and the room very small paintwork chipped and in need clean hall way outside room was dirty and although it had patio door onto roof top this was dirty and we had duck nesting in plant pot on the patioNo Positive,0
 It was quite far from the city center You have to take a tram or train to get to where all the action is in Amsterdam Having said that location is convenient if you plan to take day trips elsewhere in the Netherlands since it s very near the train station Room was also quite small but it wasn t such a pain because everything was well maintained and very clean  We were pleasantly surprised Great hotel nice interiors Clean and new with everything in order 2 minute walk from the Sloterdijk train and tram stations ,1
 Breakfast limited choices Elevators Everything ,1

We had trouble finding a hotel we stopped in here just to see how much it would be we thought it would be really expensive but it was very affordable. The room was very spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. We were a lttle worried about the neighborhood cause its said to be dangerous but absolutley nothing happened didnt even get woke up once. I would definitly stay here again.,1
 The air conditioning had been turned on so the rooms got very stuffy and warm during the night and this could not be fixed  Bar and room service staff were very accommodating and friendly Hotel location and facilities suited our needs We liked that there was a fridge in the room and milk was bought up fresh for coffee in the morning ,1

 room space is so strange and creepy  location,0
"I'm not sure if it was just my room or the hotel. There was old wallpaper in the bathroom that looked like it was glued back on the wall several years ago and without proper caulking, rust on the metal door in the wall-ceiling, old caulking in the tub-tile seam and the toilet seat looked old with scratches painted over. The lobby is nice, but the room just felt really old and outdated. It didn't feel - star quality, which was disappointing. The bartender, James was great, made good drinks, and never left you waiting for the next one.",0
No Negative Very nice staff Very good facilities ,1

"Recently had a --night stay here for the first time... Overall disappointed. Room and bathroom size aside (typical NY.. quaint..), a few things stuck out in my mind that will cause me not to return there...
There was only a sheet on the bed (and that little footer cover). No quilt-comforter. I know its summer, but come on. 
Towels - might as well been sandpaper. And there are no hand towels - just - bath sheets and - washclothes. Odd...
Service staff started cleaning at -:--am..... either make it quiet or don't use the vacuum until later.... 
Noisy - road noise was above average for being on the --th floor... windows drafty it seems.
Cleanliness - some mold growing in the corners of the bathroom... Lights haven't been dusted in years...",0
"This was a great hotel....Marriott does not disappoint! Had - adults and three small kids. We fit in the room just fine (with blow-up mattress!). The view we had was incredible (city view) and PERFECT for viewing the fireworks over the national monument. The price was steep...but it was a primo room on the -th of July....and it was well worth it! As others have said, the location was awesome....you can get to the mall in a jiffy and there were plenty of eating options nearby. We ate in the hotel's restaurant and it was convenient and good...just note that they add the gratuity on automatically (we almost didn't see this). And last but not least, the pool was the perfect temp (warm) for the little kids! Everyone had a great time at this JW Marriott....WE WILL BE BACK!",1

No Negative Everything was good specially the breakfast Room was lovely Thank you,1
 Incompetent staff at reception kettle in room didn t work Bar does not stay open in the evening for residents so be sure if you go to a late show don t expect a drink at the hotel afterwards Breakfast was average nothing special The hotel is exceptionally overpriced as is the continental breakfast delusions of grandeur and not worth the excessive prices charged there are better in the area for less money  NOT A GREAT DEAL The only good point is the location ,0
 There was nothing that I did not like  Lovely pillows very comfortable Very helpful and friendly staff Just all very pleasurable ,1
 The room is too small For the money I have paid I was expecting something just a bit more The internet free wifi was very slow Also the concierge did not answer to my phone call from the room I spent 15 20 minutes near the phone to ask a question It repeated not once seems that they have shortage in workers The breakfast was very poor standard poor quality english breakfast In addition the location is not good it is just on the road it does not have any bay for cars to drive in Was very difficult to catch a taxi because in front of the hotel the taxi could not stop by the law I did not like my stay at that hotel whereas I have paid a lot of money  The bathroom was very spacious and comfortable ,0

"We booked here because the price was good and it was near Union Square. Very small room overlooking another building but that made it quiet. It was clean with a full bath.
Handy to Theatre district but this is the furthest West I'd stay near downtown. You are on the edge of the Tenderloin and the panhandlers get progressively more aggressive as you move West from here.
The electronic key failed to work several times, which the lobby staff tried to call 'quirky' but after the -rd trip to the lobby in -- minutes - it was just annoying",0

"Although I work in NYC, my wife and I attended a wine dinner and I didn't want to drive home. The hotel was within walking distance of the restuarant, so it was perfect. The check-in process was quick, but the elevators slow (although they say they are working on upgrading them). The room was spacious and included a small, full-service kitchen (wonder if this was an apartment building in a past life?). My biggest peeve was that I took a bottle of Sierra Nevava from the fridge and found it stale. I then noticed that it was a screw off top, which Sierra hasn't made in years. Altohugh they said they would remove it, that fact that they would put this out is embarrassing. Either it has been laying around for years or their supplier is swindling them. Either way its not good. I would however stay here again.",0

"Had a fabulous stay in this hotel. Well located just off Boston Common and near to Chinatown and short walks to Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, and the Business District. Food was a bit pricey (but tasty what we did have) but some drinks were reasonable. All staff were really friendly and helpful. If I'm in Boston again, this will be top of the list.",1

"Really nice studio. Perfect for two people.<br/>Enough equipments for a short stay, really nice swimming pool with a nice view!",1
 The cleaner never clean the dresser even obviously there were empty bottle and paper tissue on it What they did was just making the bed And I really hate to live underfloor although there was a swimming pool outside my window I asked the front desk for changing a room and they told me they would inform me once they got free room but got no response anymore  The room is very big comapring to other hotels in London I ve ever lived ,0
 the room was very noisey especially in the morning got woke up by a contant banging really early each morning ordered a meal at 11pm at the bar the brought me the wrong one and said they couldn t re do the one i ordered because it was too late and the kitchen was closed but then again you can get room service food 24 hours so why couldnt they do me the one i ordered  the facillites was good and the location was very good,0
 Wifi is not the best and coffee at breakfast could be better The room and the location are really nice ,1
 The Continental breakfasts Poor quality haphazzard plates cutleryNo Positive,1
 It s seriously not a 4 star hotel it s basically a cramped travelodge in an architecturally nice location I ve literally stayed in better Premier Inns and if I d payed full price for the room I d have been livid Indifferent staff directing at breakfast made me feel like I was constantly in the wrong place and liable to be charged extras at any time not a nice feeling  Nice quiet location 10 minute walk to the tube That s it I guess the mirrors in the bathroom were clean ,0
 Could not get wifi to connect to any of my devicesNo Positive,0

 too noisyNo Positive,0
"Spacious room very clean. Check in was fast and friendly service. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choice. I would recommend this hotel just for the location. Its close to the piers. Shuttle services are available which we used and was surprised how good this was. It cost us -- dolllars each to the airport. I liked the fact the hotel has someone in the lobby who can help you with trips and entertainment. There is a pool but its outdoors and San Francisco was cold even in August. Will definately be going back to this hotel.",1
 None Executive lodge suite,0
 Being woken at 6am by the cleaning staff parking their trolleys outside the room When mentioned at reception it was greeted with a very unsincere sorry about that With no indication of what they were going to do with this information  Within walking distance of Waterloo Station and Westminster Bridge ,0
No Negative Very clean friendly hotel Comfortable stay and staff happy to help with any queries Little far to walk to the tourist parts of Barcelona Only around 7 euros in a taxi though and there is a taxi rank 30 seconds from the hotel Overall nice stay ,1
 Although we had a four post bed and it was very comfy it was a little rickety and we did feel like it might fall over Bit worn in places and stains on carpet Friendly staff especially at breakfast and the best continental breakfast I ve ever had,1
 The fact that a tray of left over food was left outside a door on the fourth floor for a full day and a half although it was reported by us on our first day Our room was good the bed was comfy and our gift of bottle of wine much appreciated,1
 The bathroom had no heating it was so cold In such a new hotel the least to expect is a holder for the toilet paper The room was directed out to a street with much traffic which made a noise stay Together the stay was too expensive 800 Euros for three nights is much too much for that hotel placed in a surburban under constraction No Positive,0
No Negative Liked the comfort of the room breakfast and the helpful front desk Location closed to everything ,1
 Dark and dismal room we knew we had booked an internal view room what we didn t know was the internal lighting in the room was so poor Location,0
No Negative No caf un th room,1
 Put signs up to direct you to the room as I got lost and the absence of a resturant and bar holds this hotel back and for that I wouldn t stay again  The style of the room is lovely and cleanlyness,0
 Do to my severe allergies to various cleaning detergents containing substance of Chlor Chlorine I have requested Booking com to prearrange with the hotel not to use any of those above however when I enter the room which was clean the strong smell of agressive chemicals have been all over the place bed laundry was so strongly bleached that person with no such allergies would have problem sleeping in it therefore I paid my bill for the room and left the hotel  I didn t like anything ,0
 Poor customer service and loud air con  Location,0
 Location Facilty,0
 Air con not working and room was very hot We were offered a move but decided to have the windows opened instead I feel this should have been checked before the room was assigned to us  Spacious room very close to Tower of London,0
 Bathroom opens into bedroom not saying this is the same for all rooms  Location location location Walk to every major tourist spot Staff A room with a view of Baker Street and windows that open I love fresh air modern renovations do not detract from the quaintness of London living Nice bar and lounge area in which to take a break Live jazzy music on a Thursday and outside seating if you want a cigarette I am from London and have to say this hotel was a treat ,1
 Room smelt of faeces clearly a problem with drains Strange grinding noises all night Powdered eggs at breakfast No Positive,0
 We always like the location and the rooms Me And My Wife have been going to this place For many years the staff attitude and service was the worst we ever experienced ,0
 Sky bar was open and too cold should have a closed area with a view  Location Great bed Super friendly staff Breakfast was very good,1
 Too small room for 2 Very poor breakfastNo Positive,0
 The restaurant was small and the menu for both restaurant and room service was fairly limited especially the vegetarian options  Family suite setup was very good The master room was lovely and the second of the 2 rooms had 2 separate sofa beds made up one for each of our children The suite had 2 toilets very useful a bath and a separate shower cubicle Breakfast although in a small restaurant was good and fairly varied The breakfast staff were excellent friendly and attentive Location was brilliant walikng distance to La Rambla Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi attractions Also a good mix of restaurants located nearby ,1
 Food menu choice is awful both in the room and breakfast hotel is about 100 years out of date run down and old and the lift Jesus can you even call that a lift Book this place only if you want to visit a 19th century castle Would not go back Bed was comfy,0
 Metro stop was a bit far but they do offer a free shuttle  Everything was amazing and luxurious ,1
 The staff weren t very helpful or overly friendly The hotel room was a bit on the dingy side though I think it is in the process of renovating  The location was pretty good walking distance to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park a few minutes walk to the tube ,0

 Nothing really The central location at Westminster Bridge and fantastic staff Nothing was a problem,1

 Receptionist on Tuesday November 8 was very unfriendly I had to wait 10 minutes until she showed up at the reception no more key cards available hotel ran out of key cards room had no window which was not mentioned on booking com when reservation was made online loud traffic noise outside during most of the night and the worst of all heating was not working with nearly zero degrees outside an awful experience No Positive,0
 Price is very high for what you get in this hotel You can get similar facilities and even similar room size which was not exceptional in much cheaper hotels in the area  The location was great especially since I had a room with a view over the pantheon Room size what decent ,0
 The area was poor and their were amounts of litter in the surrounding street  the hotel was clean and the the accommodation was adequate for my needs and in line with my expectations and provided good value for money,0
 Finding your room is a challenge  The pool and sauna were great The staff in the fitness center was also good The staffs in general were not bad ,1
 WiFi is terrible Location is perfect,0
 I was expecting a charming boutique hotel until I found out that they have 200 rooms I was surprised It s till charming but less personal than expected For the rates they apply I think the standard room classic room are rather on the small side especially the bathrooms  I appreciated the interior design in this mansion It s very nicely and stylish decorated I would recommend the bar Excellent location if you want to be in the middle of the city center ,1
 Nightmare of noise all the night long Smelly bathroom Family room has no elevator you need to use stairs Value of money is not satisfying Location View Rooftop area Parking free,0
 Rooms are tired and need to be updated and sound proofed Good location in Amsterdam near Museums and shops Excellent restaurant,0

 Hotel no the place vienna is very good  Not good,0
 The design of the bathroom looked good but floor very slippy and quite difficult to get in and out of bath shower particularly if you are short and no handles to hold on to  Good big comfy bed Decent sized room ,1
 i did not like anything nothing,0
 At checkin I was asked if I have a car whether i want a parking for it which I acknowledged and taken At checkout I found out that parking is at a fee which I was not told about at checkin furthermore when a supervisor came to resolve the issue she was very unfriendly just keen on proving that this is somehow my fault I was in a rush to catch my flight so I just paid left  Location cleanliness room size,0
picked because it was close to airport and I thought it offered free parking if flying from Denver.Found that not to be the case.Also hot tub was out of service.I always use the hot tubs as I am not into swimming.This was a big damper.I was not informed that there were issues with this when I checked in.,0
 The bed was too irm for us  The staff was helpful and friendly The location was great ,1

No Negative Quiet room and great location ,1
 The room itself was extremely small and the bathroom likewise Worst room we have ever stayed in No Positive,0
 The room was sweltering as air con is so bad that I think it breaches the trade descriptions to say this hotel has air con Not much better with the window open and then had noise until after 3am  Location fine except you have to walk with cases from the road as the Les Halles development works prevent vehicle access Lovely bar in the foyer Restaurant also spoilt by development works ,0
 Normally in Europe they don t provide a bottle of water everyday  Staffs very friendly and kind They always care of customer ,1
 Rooms should have the option of a walk in shower  Breakfast too expensive,1
No Negative The hotel was situated in a great position for us to get to The Palace Theatre ,1
 The pillows were very cheap The library room had interesting books,0
 The rudeness of the pool terrace staff and the continual overcharging for drinks Ed was extremely comfy,0
 The room was freezing cold but as I only arrived in it after midnight after a long and arduous check in process as our short notice bookings had not been efficiently transferred across by booking com I didn t have either the time or inclination to work out how to operate the heating Bed and pillows were remarkably uncomfortable but again too late to do anything about it Left before breakfast to get early train  nothing at all ,0
 Perhaps better Sauna as it was a little small Nice staff,1
 Lifts difficult to operate not obvious about use of the key Everyone was confused about this  Beautiful hotel in every way ,1

 Room fee did not include breakfast and the room is too small Fire alarm went off in the morning  Location is superb ,0
 I could not arrange late check out It as a good hotel in good place ,1
 A bit old fashioned and very over priced Room looked out over the roof of a garage  Location was ok for the tube but nothing to do or nowhere to go locally ,0
 Sadly it s a bit too far from the tube to walk so I would have preferred a hotel closer to London Bridge such as the Hilton and then saved on all the taxis  The quality of the room service food and the cooked breakfast was excellent ,1
No Negative Spacious room Very clean Very friendly and efficient staff The door man ran to the end of the road to hail me a cab Very impressive service ,1

 There is a school right next the hotel and we had to hear loud voices every morning  Wifi was great location was good ,0
 The absence of customer service in terms of changing our booking All it would take is for human intervention to resolve the problem not that hard  Weird electrical system in the room,0
 Cramped room sold to me as a superior room dread to think what an ordinary room is like Bed was comfy ,0
 The room s were very very small the picture s were not accurate at all The hotel bar had a very poor selection of drinks  Breakfast was very good at the henry viii hotel Nice quiet location ,0
"This was a very clean, nice hotel. My room on the third floor was renovated with a flat screen TV and a new bed. This hotel looked brand new. The outdoor area wasn't resort like, however the large pool was much nicer than your standard pool. The airport was also very close by.
Overall, nicer than I expected.",1
 The mattress of the bed clearly needed changing it was very soft and saggy consequently little sleep  Location for the south bank being able to use the river boat rather than underground and taxis also lots of things in walkable distance ,0

 Basic rooms very small with smaller than average length beds Very difficult to close the bathroom door anyone on the larger side would have a real problem without needing to stand in the bath Could not open the window and the Air Con was temperamental Hard to believe there will be 85 rooms in this building and without an additional breakfast area can only see it will be packed  Modern clean hotel except the builders were still there despite the hotel website stating that works would be finished in October Staff were very friendly and helpful ,0

"Tried to arrange a small banquet for a post-funeral. Because of timing of death contacted front desk on a Friday afternoon for a Monday afternoon event for about --. NOBODY available to commit, no way to get a hold of sales and catering, and when the person at the front desk said they'd try to find someone I gave them till Saturday noon to get back to me. No one did and then when I called back the person at the desk said they just couldn't commit till Monday morning when sales and catering was available. So I called the Doubletree in Carmel Valley (- minutes away) and front desk person located the Executive Chef within -- minutes who called me back and made arrangements. If this is indicative of the service difference between the two hotels you would be wise to choose Doubletree over Woodfin for all needs.",0
 The room is too small and the room in shutesbury is at basement  The address is near paddington station ,0
 Temperature in small double was above 25 degrees C in february Only solution offered was the advice to open the window This opened to a shared balcony fire exit structure which enabled easy access to intruders I hardly slept the 3 nights I spend there Staff was polite but did not offer solutions They advised me to contact the hotel manager via mail He reacted a week later and clearly did not care at all This is a well known problem in this hotel I heard other guests who were offered another room against extra costs Apart from the heat the room was very basic no chair no working space  Breakfast,0

"I had a good stay here. Nothing was too memorable. It served it's purpose! At check in, we had a bad front desk person. He just looked depressed. The rooms were clean and spacious. The concierge was sweet and pointed us to some exciting night life.
Our TV didn't work.
The shower was clogging so the water would rise up!
I did like that every time we called down to front desk a requested something, we would get a follow up call like -- minutes later to make sure our needs were met!",0

 Hotel Room is old and dirty Staff was not friendly The wifi password did not work and the staff acted like I did it wrong turns out the wifi password expired and they didn t even say sorry  Only the location was decent,0
 For the price this hotel is not good value for money The rooms are small and the decor rather gaudy Unfortunately there was so much road work going on around the hotel that it made getting about almost impossible and while this isn t the hotel s fault it did colour our impressions of the hotel s location While the staff were pleasant enough the breakfast was ordinary and not what I would have expected for the price  This is a unique hotel with an interesting history ,0

 We ve got blinded by the 5 Stars This was definitely not what we expected The hotel seems outdated at least from the outside and we ve much rather stayed in the city center We ve called the room service and asked for some silverware and they wanted to charge 7 5 Euros to bring a fork from the kitchen to the room They offered water from plastic cups in the lobby and the water cooler was empty for our entire stay This is a good metaphor for our stay at this hotel It seems to be more of a 3 star conference hotel Definitely not 5 stars  The hotel was definitely clean ,0

 There was no window in my room but that was clearly defined in my booking which had its specific rate Perhaps window like portraits on the wall would be my suggestion to make the windowless rooms look less boring The bathroom could do with a modern refurb  The staff were very friendly and helpful I also enjoyed the therapeutic low key instrumental music that sieved through The rooms were clean The breakfast and dinner was superb I didn t have to go searching any where else for a decent meal in the area ,0
The rooms are suicide proof. Meaning that the windows are bolted shut. No fresh air will be allowed to enter your room. Internet is expensive unless you've worked your way up to the SPG platinum level where it's free. All gold and lower status card members recieve no perks. Food is good but pricy. Hotel is totally non smoking.,0
 The pictures were nothing like the venue in fact I m still looking for the bar No Positive,0

 Bed was a bit too hard for me but my husband liked it Tea coffee facilities in room would be preferable to the free toiletries  Room was a suite rather than a room with sofa bed Fantastic circular bath Shuttle service efficient Staff helpful ,1
 Stained and worn carpets Small space Too many doors in room took up more space than necessary making it even smaller  The location was nice One block from Hyde Park ,0
 Not at all a 4star hotel more like a 2 Terrible Broken hairdryer stained carpets mouldy bathroom cabinet electric wires all over the floor nails screws sticking out from the skirting boards wallpaper coming off the walls Broken shower Cooked Breakfast comes from the hotel across the road So it was cold and disgusting Definitely not worth the money I had booked it as a celebration I was planning on proposing to my boyfriend and it was our friends birthday Totally ruined due to crappy hotel  The location,0
 The room are very small the bathrooms are awful and very old fashion The furniture are deppressive and the whole price does not worth it It is overated i guess and i won t ever repeat my experience The only advantage it is that the hotel is close to angel station which facilitated transaportation,0
 Price is a bit too much should be a little cheaper Rooms staff,0
 Poor quality breakfast Chaotic table service Comfortable room,0
 The walls and floors were a little thin so you could hear other guests easily The whirl pool bath wasn t clean you could see glitter and bits of skin when you got it going  Staff were lovely Even sent back some earrings I d left in the room The room was very nice and the location was good Upgraded for free Good value for money The bed was super comfy ,1
No Negative love this hotel everything about it particularly the Cocktails be good to get a hot breakfast in the price though rather than just continental however it was very good,1
 Staff is slow Breakfast is poor  Location close to Paddington station Quite place ,1
 Modern gadgets used in the hotel were aged and at times simply did not function We had problems with both the blind in the room and the air conditioning Although the size was fine the slanted ceiling of our room on the 5th floor made our stay difficult for two tall individuals I also received emails from the hotel intended for other guests which was slightly unprofessional  Eccleston Square is a great location very close to Victoria station and conveniently close to the Chelsea area ,0
The overall appearance and service at the hotel was okay. My room was a little dirty with dried ketchup on the table and mold in the bathroom by the bathtub. The area under the table had not been swept.,0
 Too warm in the room and the fan we were provided with wasn t effective  The location is wonderful the staff were very helpful and the decor is lovely ,1
 Limited in premises services and public areas Good proximity to train stations and restaurants,0
 The restaurant was very large and cavernous felt more like an indoor sports arena The location was a bit out of bounds but a short way to the metro station Otherwise you need a car nothing within walking distance  Very nice rooms good value for money ,0
"I was so lucky to get this hotel when bidding on priceline. It was supposed to be for a King size bed but they were so accomodating and gave us two double beds and did their best to get us a room with view of the bay. The room was so big and comfy. loved the fireplace. and the bathroom was so nice and clean! I loved the decor, sort of a rustic with a cute Bear and a small deer for our feet to rest. I also loved the view from their restaurant surrounded by water. It was a great hotel, very close to Pike market and downtown Seattle.",1

 Bed was very uncomfortable and the mattress far too small for the frame room smelt strongly of air freshener and overlooked a dumping area for old bits of metal  Good location ,0
 Food Not much variety in buffet breakfast that we paid for Children did not eat as such They remained hungry Not every food item was labelled specially a bread with pork in it was not labelled Beds were separate too My husband and I slept on separate beds on a holiday we paid alot for How silly is that Our room did not have any views as such except a mosaic wall that was part of hotel  Communication with staff was easy Close to metro and other facilities ,0

No Negative As always the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful We feel welcome and really enjoy staying here ,1
 The room had no natural light and on booking I requested a view the receptionist was very unhelpful when I queried this saying it is a City Twin what did I expect we were then woken by loud hammering on the door at 5am by a drunken guest who had been in the hotel bar drinking all night the cooked breakfasts were very slow and sub standard we also had a lengthy booking our process as we were invoiced for the breakfast but this was include in the room rate I showed her the confirmation with it clearly written and after several phone calls they finally believed me and agreed to take it off all in all very embarrassing and disappointing No Positive,0
 We were given a free upgrade upon arrival from the deluxe to club room However it was very small and dark which made getting ready for our ball in the evening rather difficult The road in the morning was also very noisy from around 7am considering it was a Sunday  The location was very good close to the station and local shops ,0

 this hotel shouldn t have 4 star with 8 7 ranking We were in this hotel for 4 night one they in the morning I signed for clear room and asked reception at 8 Am for cleaning room but in the 16 when I came back they did not clean it and I asked to clean after 18 and they said we quit after 18 another day I signed Do not disturb and when I came back an electric technician was in my room and worked on lamp breakfast quality was very low and I payed 14 Euro for each day two times I asked for bottle of water and reception told me we are busy now I asked for an extra blanket and I received dirty blanket  Nothing,0

 Unable to run bath took 45 mins Staff responded within 10 mins but problem not fixed and the promise of a room change never happened Room very very small Mini bar had selection of drink but only one beer Hotel bar hard to find very small so couldn t get in it Sat night Draughty windows and shabby curtains  Well situated ,0
 1st impressions count for a lot and the expense of a new entrance stair carpet would not be wasted While the Seraphine offers enough for a 1 night stay beyond a small breakfast room there are no facilities outside your room Had I not been traveling alone and on business these might have contributed to lower rating  Spacious clean and comfortable room real value for the price Location is superb Despite the name it is actually 50 yards from Kensington Park a little longer walk through Hyde Park to Oxford Street and buses into Trafalgar Square leave from across Kensington High Street Staff are extremely welcoming ,1
 Rooms were small for the price paid and lacked few basic facilities in the rooms  Welcoming staff clean room good location ,0
 Next to Sloane road where they race and rev cars we were on 12th floor and still so loud we had to wear ear plugs and pillows over the head Also the room had a serious musty smell and so we had to leave the window open pretty consistently  Room keepers did a good job,0
 Very small tired and scruffy rooms not at all value for money Bathroom tiny shower curtain failed and bathroom floor soaked in minutes poor toilet flush Very very poor for cost of rooms Location and reception area very nice,0
"The Affinia is more like serviced apartments rather than a hotel, your rooms are nice, clean and tidy but you have a small lounge with kitchen area (fridge, hob, sink, microwave, etc). You can still order room service and such should you want it.
The staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel is a bit dated but still very clean. You could hear the traffic at night but it was rather distant. We were central so walking to times square, theatres, night life etc were close by. The hotel is across the road from madison square gardens - I would recommend you watch a match of sorts there.
I would recommend a visit to the statue of liberty, times square, top of rockafella centre.",0

 Staff who checked me in wasn t well spoken or courteous Was extremely unorganised and took long to check me in A 5 star hotel shouldn t be unorganised and keep guest waiting at checking for nearly 20 minutes I wouldn t stay here again due to bad customer service I received from one particular staff who checked me in  Hotel is gorgeous and in a nice location Room is spacious and clean ,0
 Other hotel guests letting doors slam Otherwise brilliant  Great location with excellent hotel facilities and ever helpful staff Easy access to underground but within walking distance to all major attractions ,1

"This was a fairly typical economy level motel. It does have a swimming pool, but we were just passing through and were unable to take advantage of the pool. There were a number of reviews of this motel that mentioned how helpful the person named Fazli at the front desk was, but our stay was during his days off. However Matthew was quite helpful and friendly as well.",0
 We were further out than what we thought we would be Only a 15 minute walk to the nearest train station Some parts of the area didn t feel safe so we avoided walking in at night Our room was spacious and very clean Not too many facilities on the property but the breakfast was awesome A bit out from the centre but an easy walk to the train station ,1
 Housekeeping knocking too early In the morning followed a little later by a housekeeping manager I think walking directly into our room Room overlooked the road and entrance so was a little noisy Film crew setting up at 5 in the morning was not conducive to sleep out of the hotel s control I m sure  Location was perfect,1
The Affinia Hotel was a perfect hotel for a girls getaway! The location is ideal - near mag. mile shopping. The roof top bar is great as well. I would recommend to anyone and everyone! Thanks for the hospitality :),1

 Worst experience using Booking com Booking recommended a Deluxe King Room to me for 2 adults and 2 children however when I arrived at the hotel they told me I can t stay in that room because We have 4 people even though my little daughter is only 8 months old I have to upgrade the room to a Junior Suite and cost me 200 euros more It s a terrible experience and I contacted Booking right away but got no reply until now 12 days passed  Great location ,0

 The description size of the room was over exaggerated For a deluxe double it was extremely small For the price and the description I would ve expected a bit more space  The breakfast as a whole was extremely good ,0
 My idea of a 4 star hotel based on my experience is far from what that hotel offered Small room poor hotel facilities roof top space opened until 8pm that s a joke I would expect much better for the price  One and only advantage of the hotel is its location Very nice surroundings with lots of restaurants and within walking distance to major turist attractions ,0
 Bar is very quiet and no TV Remarkably discrete location Spacious room,1
 We did not like only room service menu is very poor only option is club sandwich and burger that I can say It service is very very slow once we order a club sandwich and raddison blu burger and it took 45 50 mins to deliver to the room and also burger was too cold and we paid 60 for it and did not enjoy with the food at all Please improve your room service quality  Rooms are big enough and comfortable there coffee shops market and restaurants around the hotel very close to red lights and dam square Especially bar in the hotel it was cool and we really enjoy with wine that Mr barman suggested us thanks a lot cant remember his name Thanks to management and staff you made our little vacation memorable We definitely come back again ,1

 Though I enjoyed the breakfast on the first day I found a hair in my eggs the second time I visited the restaurant The staff seemed oblivious about my complaint and asked me whether I wanted another set of poached eggs But I was just so turned off by the attitude I politely declined and left the restaurant I also requested a King size bed but was surprised to have two single beds joined together Some of the staff seemed pretentious which was a disappointment It wasn t at all comfortable for the money they charge  Location is perfect and the historical references within the property is amazing Opera house is next door which is nice if you re planning to watch a show Rooms are classy and well maintained ,0
 Staff did not listen or speak good enough English I was offered a newspaper and gave my preferred choice it was not delivered then the incorrect paper was given always I had to get up to the knock on the door a very unrestful morning not enough tea bags a problem on arrival was not dealt with quickly by reception when I gave my concerns to the the member of staff the concierge it was sorted out not what I expected at this 5 star hotel bed big and comfy plus pillow very clean big room,0

 Poor design of corridors lobby stairs at the entrance Decent room very small,0
 The check in and check out process was painful the staff looked quite confused at almost everything we said and we had to speak to managers a few times to make sure that the rooms were settled correctly and check in and check out took a very long time  The breakfast was lovely although a shame they could find us a big enough table for our group of 11 we had to split across several tables The rooms were absolutely lovely and especially the one bedroom suites they had superb views across Westminster Bridge ,1

 I stayed with my partner for 1 night and it wasnt great when house keeping knocked at half 8 and woke us up by opening the door when we didnt check out untill 12  Staff were very friendly rooms were very clean and tidy and spacious ,1
 the room is really for a couple because after turning the sofa in a bed for our 11 years daughter you don t have enough space for your luggage Resuming if you want to stay in that hotel with kids I suggest you to find other options for couples is fine Also for a 4 star hotel breakfast must have more fruit options we normally found 2 options only hotel location is good close to many of Barcelona main sightseeing also a very quiet region and close to Metro lines,0
 No toiletry even sleepers unless you asked for it They provided body and hair shampoo only The staffs hardly smile I believe their smile will light up the hotel Anyway I like their service  Good location nice food clean room I stay first three nights on the third floor having nice view and quiet room ,1
 The room was too loud Sewer pipes seemed to be in the room Housekeeping staff worked and talked very loud directly in front of the door which had a big gap So we were not able to sleep off  Nice view from the roof top ,0
"Overall a very good experience at this hotel which is very well sited in San Antonia. Whilst it is older stock it is well maintained and clean. The big bonus being downtown is the free car parking. The short walk to the Alamo and the River Walk was good with the high temp. always evident.
The breakfast was excellent and well stocked.",1
 The room wasn t as clean on arrival as I would normally expect Great location for connectivity it s a short 20 minute taxi ride from the airport and close to central station,1
 Lack of a bit of privacy with the way in which the restaurant tables are set up  I normally never dine in the hotel I am staying in and so was pleasantly surprised by the excellent food I had on both the nights I stayed at this hotel ,1
No Negative Fabulous hotel and wonderful staff ,1
 The room is quite small but not out of the norm for Europe There is very little room to have suitcases open  We had a triple room and it was very comfortable sleeping for three people Good storage in the room for odds and ends The bathroom was actually quite large for Europe and was very modern The shower was exceptional Lots of hot water and great water pressure Nice room with wood beams in the ceiling and a view of the street in front of the Sorbonne The location was excellent on a pedestrian square with restaurants and access to lots of shopping and other restaurants with a short walk ,1
 The staffs attitude No Positive,0
 I had to pay to use the facilities this is crazy I have never heard of this before and you should never have to pay for these it is an absolute disgrace Whatmore it is smelly there are people smoking in the corridors outside the bedrooms  The location is very good and easy to access by tube The beds are comfortable and it is in a quiet are ,0
"Overall we had a good stay at the Colonnade. As others have reported, the hotel is in a very convenient location and taxis were easy to find (assisted by the very helpful and pleasant doormen.) The concierge was very helpful in arranging a car and a driver for our next destination and the front desk allowed us a slightly later check out which made a big difference to the organisation of our last day. Our room was perfectly comfortable and well equipped. The only negative of our visit was Brasserie Jo; it was expensive and on one night the service was very indifferent. The food was fine but for the price and the hype, I would have expected more. We would return to the Colonnade, but would probably not eat at Brasserie Jo, except for a quick breakfast.",1
 No free wifi in a modern London hotel Seemed very odd to have to pay for this  Lovely quiet room,1
 Very unpleasant Staff No Positive,0
 The noise of the lift motors Nice bar environment,0
 Service was terrible Dirty coffee pot from the previous stay housekeeping didn t replace dirty glasses or cups request for new cups and glasses was never adhered to  Location was great Convenient to city center and transportation hub ,0
 The price could be 100 00 less The breakfast couldn t be served to us in our room There isn t a sauna steam room jacuzzi just a swimming pool only Car park should be free if staying at hotel include in room price  The heated toilet The TV in bathroom mirror shower and bath Sky channels The view The bed The staff and service ,1
No Negative The comfortable surroundings in the room,1
 No wifi The room was spacious and very clean,1
 Small room and apartments but this is not a big problem you are in Paris and most of the hotels like that The adapter should be free of charge once I return it to the reception before check out Mini bar drinks is little expensive 3 5 for each drink  Location is perfect Staff very friendly specialy Mr hamza many thanks to him Easy chick in and check out ,1
 Had to wait a long time for items to be topped up at breakfast Something food or drink had splashed on wall in restaurant and not been cleaned right  It was nice to have a pool but didn t have time to use it Room was clean neat and quiet ,1
 The size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it  Location of the hotel it s decoration and specially the staff were very good,0
 breakfast is a joke poor quality not worth the money you have restaurants near by heating not adjustable was a little chilly still looks like being under construction private parking means you have to park your car at a nearby 50m away Ibis hotel if you dare to park in front of or near the hotel you will get a fine or even your car will be towed although there is NO sign warning you to purchase any parking ticket can only be bought from WestBahnhof 400m away this is a total rip off hotel staff does not warn you about this  rooms were nice comfortable beds big and clean bathroom,0
"Arriving in foyer first impessions very good ,very secure -- hrs security,cafe and shops inside the hotel,very busy all the time which is quite comforting.We were on the third floor and I must admit the first impressions of the landing was not good,padded doors,dark coridoors and peeling paper.However,rooms were large,clean and loads of hot water which is basically what you need!Didnt see one bed bug ,girls in our group next door to me had a problem with toilet which was fixed promptly.Ok, you could have a more modern interior but you would compromise on space and when you have groups of - sharing ,space is essential.I liked the Art Deco feel of the hotel and we explored other floors which were higher speck so I guess you get what you pay for but it was great for us. I will definately recommend his hotel to others.",0
 Nothing Fantastic hotel would definitely recommend ,1
"We booked the romance package at omni.com which includes a pre-visit phone call from the concierge. She called a few days prior to our visit and was very helpful and accommodating to my requests. When we arrived, we loved the tasteful Texas decor and the feel of the hotel. We received an upgrade so ended up in a beautiful suite. Everything that comes with the romance package was set up in our room. I also joined the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""omni select"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" memership online, which also has a few extra perks, and we received all of those as well, just as promised. 
The hotel was beautiful, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food we ate there in the restaurant, both for breakfast and lunch, was delicious.",1
 It seems that this hotel is running it s last days no internet for some reason they stoped using the key card system No Sky TV anymore and the staff seems not to be that much motivated anymore No Positive,0
 This was the second time I had booked this hotel and for the second time they had overbooked and tried to move me to their sister hotel the other side of Paddington When I complained that I wasn t happy a room was available within minutes Room not turned down on one day of stay Again only when we asked for a top up of milk and coffee did a cleaner knock the door by which point it was too late as we were getting ready for our night out Won t be booking again as concerned they may try and move again No Positive,0
 There was no kettle coffee or tea nor drinking water in the room We have to go to the breakfast restaurant to get a coffee or water when I need one Fanny enough I was told only at check out that I could have asked for the kettle and coffee making facilities in fact we asked the reception almost everyday for a cup of tea The shower hot water was temperamental hit and cold as it likes We stayed at 6th floor there was building job started at 7am very annoying  The receptionist Miss Yana is very good The breakfast is fairly satisfied ,0
 machine for shoes cleaning breakfast,1
 No fresh fruit available on breakfast Room service very good,1
 there are steps as you enter and no ramps for cases the lack of staff meant i wait 20 mins to check in as i was waiting for someone to be free to help carry the cases No Positive,1
"This hotel was horrible. It wasn't clean. It had no soaps, no shampoos, and, of course, there were the bed bugs! We were in the room for maybe an hour, and we left. The front desk staff did not charge us, so I was pleased by that. By far the worst La Quinta experience we've had. My husband is ready to write off the whole chain.",0
We stayed at the Homestead Suites for the Austin City Limits Music Festival. This hotel is definitely the best location for the most econimical price. I have paid onwards from $--- for a hotel during the festival which wasn't as convenient for walking-biking to the festival. If you normally look to stay in the lap of luxury pass this one by but if you are looking for cleanliness and convenience TRY IT!,0
 Wi Fi awkward Good staff very clean,1
 We have been repeated 4 times our needs for the reception stuff while they did it Rooms are not really soundproofed  Location perfect breakfast ok ,0
 The bed is squicking the floor is with no carpet which can be slippery and cold since the room sandals are not provided  The location of the hotel is perfect There is a huge mall across the hotel the tramp stop is 1 minute away and the hop on hop off bus stop is right in front of the hotel building ,1
 The elevator was out of order for 5 days which made it very hard and congested using the other available elevator  The location of the hotel,0
No Negative We were in the City for a wedding this hotel was centrally located and fuss free from the moment we arrived It had everything we needed great spot if you re looking for a hotel as a base to tour around at weekends and quieter than the West End for sleeping,1
 I wanted to watch TV the cable wasnt plugged because it was broken i asked for help from reception unfortunately the technician wasnt available I found it outrageous for a room that cost me Eur 450  The location is good and there is a big mirror above a chimney that are nice the only nice thing in the room,0
 I booked a room with the view and I didn t get it there was no toilet paper in the bathroom the Paris Map was completely cut I could just see the adverstisment around the map The cleaner tryed to come in my room at 8 30 waking me up I had the worse experience ever the staff told me the manager would have call me the day after to propose me a discount for next time but it didn t happen No Positive,0
 hotel restroom facilities have been used by tourists walking by When we tried to use them an Italian school class was occupying it Quiet unusual maybe this is due to the fact that the hotel staff by the way very helpful is Italian too  Breakfast area was very nice and the buffet time was extended for late morning arrivals,1
 There was no heat in the room which was absurd given the 600 night cost There was mold in the bathroom The custom airport pickup was 1 hour late The room size was perfect if you were 3 feet tall  The staff was accommodating when we checked out 50 early ,0
 The rooms were really small The food was terrible and undercooked It was impossible to find our room We paid for a view of a car park Not worth the money at all  It was tidy,0
 Housekeeper they stole my item from my room while cleaning my room Location,1
 Location was fine for us as walkers but was a bit out of the city centre although good bus service nearby  Wonderful croissants and excellent all round breakfast although could have been refreshed more frequently Westerpark nearby was wonderful ,1
 Late night reception staff slow checkin the facilities and gym,0
 the hotel was expensive The location of the hotel was so good for me because i was able to buy things mostly all the time befoer midnight,0
 The room smelled bad humid toiletsmell when we entered the room The elevator makes real doubtfull noises Decoration of the room outdated Nice guy at the reception Good beds,0
 The air extractor in the Bathroom ran all night I couldn t sleep past 06 00 The shower fittings fell apart When we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared We too had an overlong wait for breakfast No Positive,0
 Our welcome at the reception left a lot to be desired not sure if the woman had a bad day but it wasn t the friendly reception that I was normally used to from your group There was also a misunderstanding with our pre booked late check out as the floor manager walked straight into our room after knocking once only which could have been very embarrassing  This booking was all about location as it is in the heart of London so almost easy access to everything ,1
 Bathroom door lock stuck closed and handle didn t open the door for ages Room 414 Also shower mixer does not work so had really hot shower as couldn t turn it down  Your are so close to Canary Wharf it easy for me to do business and stay over although not when I am late because I got stuck in your bathroom,0
 Nice entrance rooms were like a 70s Blackpool guest house Staff were rude rooms weren t clean facilities were awful  Location,0
 Very mediocre hotel value for money absolutely unacceptable staff systematically overstrainedNo Positive,0
 Minor but TV not working to receive international news channels Checkin not helped as we d arrived early from overnight train to Vienna but couldn t check in till after 12 30 Probably just unlucky as previous guests stayed till last moment Great location Comfortable spacious room Friendly and helpful staff Produced a kettle so I could make tea in our room,1
 Nothing One of the staff called angelo is best staff in all hotels around the world,1
 Totally inefficient air conditioning making it extremely uncomfortable The setting said 16c but the room temperature was probably in the upper 20s Totally unacceptable I complained during the evening but there was no improvement making it difficult to sleep On checking out I made further complaints and was offered points on my IHG account to use elsewhere Still waiting for the points Pity as the hotel room was very clean and well appointed Would not go back unless there was confirmation that the ac was working perfectly Th room we had was 1111 Location within minutes of Gloucester Road tube station Great breakfast with plenty of choice Choice of pillows ,0
 We felt like the room let us down this made us want to eat out and just use the hotel for sleeping  Staff was the best part of the hotel five stars for the customer service ,0
 They did not return the deposits they took from my credit card I m still trying stay away No Positive,0

 Sofabed not very comfortable Loved the bar and grill great service great food amazing buffet breakfast The Hotel is in a perfect location concierge always available to help get transportation Loved It there,1
 Noisy dirty poorly maintained lack of service wrongly rated I have photos of taps dripping sink with waste water that wouldn t empty hairs on toilet seats the list goes on and on Save your hard earned cash We are a late 30s and early 40s professional couple normal couple with normal expectations  Location is the only thing going for this hotel I do not write reviews normally but feel compelled to warn others with hard earned cash to spend it elsewhere this hotel does not deserve my or your hard earned money,0
 check out too early 10 30 am  Good location Friendly staff ,1
 A lot of noise in the room no minibar  The breakfast chef always polite and kind ,0
 many coulours small ascensure only for 1 small rooms i liked location,0
 If the ground floor restaurant bar could have a stronger air container the dinning condition will be even better Was a bit hot in the restaurant for our dinner  Second time stay in this hotel All the staffs in the hotel were very nice and helpful Especially the gentleman called Dominique who works at the front service counter Both the breakfast on the hotel s basement level and the dinner on the ground level were great Definitely will come back again ,1
 Staff was not so communicative Answers to our questions were not so clear It looked like the staff was not in their mood But it can t be said about the security staff they were really nice and much more communicative than the staff at the reception  In general hotel is good Nice and rich breakfast Security was very nice and friendly smiley Good location some 15 minutes from the beach ,0
 Expensive Variety although expensive,0
 Is in the middle of nowhere for food or seeing anything Comfortable rooms very quiet great showers has a tiny gym but at least still a gym good presentation,0
 Our room was modern and recently renovated but lacked finishing touches There was nowhere in the bathroom to put a toilet bag for example The toilet is in a glass box albeit frosted and so lacked privacy The grounds around the hotel are in need of an upgrade so it currently feels drab  Free parking on site Short walk to metro station ,0
 Fridge did not work Room was a bit small for what was paid Stayed for 4 nights and sheets were not changed once  Bed was comfy and the shower was good ,0
 The room was small and dirtyNo Positive,0
 The breakfast was tasteless and boring The location of the place ,0
No Negative Great selection for breakfast Comfortable room Great bar with a view ,1
 Nothing  The hotel feels very homely with thought put into the little details such as good china and quality decor It s positioned well there is metro just around the corner and if you re feeling up to it the walk down the main avenue into Milan is a delight The breakfast was very good with the added option to eat al fresco in there wonderful garden I d definitely stay again home from home ,1
 For guests staying on top floor staff can be a bit more helpful proactive in helping to get luggage up very steep flight of stairs  amazing room great hotel restaurant accommodating staff ,1

 Hotel quite old Location is good very central,0
No Negative Nothing,0
 Nothing at all Easy check in very nice crew confortable and perfectly located hotel gifts such as chocolate and drinks free upgrade as the hotel was not fully booked,1
 The check in area lacked substance and an identity Staff were very friendly but the surrounding area was boring No nice vases of flowers just had no ambience at all  Fantastic bedroom and hotel was spotlessly clean Nice bar ,1
 The only thing to improve is a noise from a water bomb or something that was annoying at times at night  The location is great there is one metro station meters away to get to Duomo area The staff is very kind and the spa was also very good ,1
 A bit far from central Good breakfast,1
 The property is very old All the furniture are very unlike and the design of the room looks like in mid ages The door of toilet was really damage and unpainted The toilet and the room spells really bad I paid around 370 euro for one night for my myself my wife and my son And what i got was really far from this priceNo Positive,0

 Almost everything needs a serious renovation The room looked shabby Small old TV Very strange bras over the beds that never give you a chance to read before falling asleep This is the worst 5 star hotel I have ever stayed Boring breakfasts are in the boring cafe  The staff was fine Good location ,0
Kevin is an extremely helpful and responsive host. He tried his best to accommodate guests requests. Another highlight of the stay is the view from the balcony.,1
 Tea coffee in room was poor so were toiletries we ran out of shower gel Breakfast buffet was poor and the croissants and coffee at the bar in the same restaurant were better My family shared a room next door and had quite a few problems with the alarm clock which really upset their stay  Good bed clean compact room,1
 Air conditioning was too noisy Loft room was lovely,1
No Negative The customer service at this Hilton was just brilliant our room was great and had everything we needed the Pool and gym were easy to find and use and felt pretty luxurious You really couldn t be better situated to enjoy the Tate Globe or even a short walk over the bridge to St Pauls ,1

 Again the mini bar extortionate prices Remember to bring your own into room at night I had a snickers bottle of water and mini box of pringles that cost me 15  Everything apart from mini bar prices Bottle of water 5 ,1
 The hotel rooms need some refurbishment because it is not new  The hotel is nice and comfortable the rooms are big enough with al the furniture needed like writing desk sofa and little table The rooms were clean The location is very convenient for visits to the Natural History Museum Science Museum and Victoria and Albert museum which are worth to visit ,1
The apartment is clean and is located in convenient spot. There is a super market close by so purchasing food/others. Tony is fantastic. He's accommodating to special circumstances and flexible to changes in time. He helped us get a city tour and allowed us to check in later than the time allocated.,1
 lunch could have been complementary similar to other hotels  the best thing about the place is its location the facility is ok although my room was a bit small but overall i had a pleasant stay and a good experience ,1

 No soap on arrival in room Waste bin standing on sink area one day Room not made up at 1630 one dsy No soap another day 30 minutes to arrange a taxi to an event one morning so gave up and organised myselfNo Positive,0
"The rooms are very small, yet bathrooms are a fair size. Definitely a boutique hotel. Reminds me of staying at a bed and breakfast in Europe. Nothing fancy AT ALL! Location is pretty good, but with high taxi prices getting to theaters, and around town, may want to stay closer to where you want to visit. They keep a small staff..probably becuz of the expense of real estate and size of hotel, so don't expect much. This is a good stay for a bed and shower and a quiet location. No frills.",0
No Negative This hotel is in a lovely area with lots of bars bistros and restaurants in walking distance Its very accessible by several different metros and bus routes The hotel has a lovely courtyards to sit in with deck chairs and umbrellas The reception staff were very helpful and knowledgable gave us lots of good tips Our superior room was comfortable and had everything we needed even a little kitchen A real bonus the hotel provided a free use mobile called a Handy which if you don t have data on your phone is perfect great tips for travel tourist sites routes on metro and calling each other when lost ,1
 outdated not very clean staff at breakfast was awful the pillows are uncomfortable very noisy if you get a room facing the street oh yeah and no proper curtains so don t exoect a good night s sleep  the location is great and the breakfast is good ,0
 Moved to another hotel at the eleventh hour situated on the ground floor of an annex next to the front door and lift I booked above ground Had to cross a road to go to breakfast  The staff were lovely,0
 Arrived on a January evening and the window was open must have been open since morning cleaning as it was an ice box Also difficult to sleep in The room has a little green emergency light by the door but because the room is so small this light illuminates the whole room Rang reception and advice given was to just cover it It was on the roof Covering it wasn t possible unless you happen to have some velcro with you  Location was convenient ,0

 The price of breakfast was not made clear don t have the a la carte and items such as a bread roll or just cereal from the buffet breakfast as they charge as if you had had the full quota Stick to one or the other  Great location Can walk to most theatres We stayed in Rm 81 which had just been refurbished so was absolutely lovely and very quiet even though on the road side Ladies there was actually a dressing table mirror and hairdryer plug all in the same place ,1
 The bad thing is that you arrive to the mane entrance and they don t ley you in even to take off your luagage sending you to the back door unpleasent thing to enter the hotel from the back door especially the hotel is rated as a 4 All the beautiful that you see in the picture is cheap plastic as well as the glasses for breakfast The restaurant is extremly posh a lot money for less food  The parking is big and secure If you need to get to the center of Milan the train station is very close ,0

"Stayed for two nights while in town on business. Great location, just - blocks from Reading Terminal Market, a stone's throw to the convention center and a short walk to great restaurants and the major tourist attractions. Room size was good, had an issue with the TV but maintenance solved this in short order. Unfortunately, dinner at the restaurant was very disappointing and so was room service. Next time I stay, I will be sure to eat elsewhere",0

"We stayed at this hotel for - nights. It is a very quaint and charming hotel. You do feel as though you are staying at your grandmother's house, flowery wallpaper, antiques, etc. Our only complaint is there is no a-c and it did get in the --s while there. So the room was quite warm. We were able to open the windows, but there iare no screens, so we were ate alive by the mosquitoes. That's is our only complaint, but a deal breaker when we return to SF. Otherwise, it is in a great location to Union Square and the cable car.",0

"You have to ask for the cruise package because it is not advertised on their web site. Beautiful rooms and views, wonderful people from the front desk, to the bar, to the driver who takes you to the port--everyone treats you as if they own part of the hotel--love it!!..
Breakfast is included with the rooms--the variety was good but the food was cold---a shame because the quality was there---there's just something about cold eggs...yuk.
I would stay here again and strongly recommend it to anyone.",1

 Our room was very cold It was actually warmer outside At one point we had to open our door and window to get heat We called down twice and was told that the heat would be turned up twice and it wasn t We also think the room price and the price of parking is high but it s still an ok hotel  I like the location Not central London but near and they took very good care of a parcel I had delivered ,0

"We haven't managed to book a stay at the Casablanca. I can only describe their reception as totally inefficient & non communicative!
I have been trying to book two rooms for seven nights accommodation in August but they have so far ( three weeks later!) failed to respond at all to my two e mail requests.
Having read the glowing reviews of service, I feel very 
disapointed and have decided that they don't deserve our business.
I have never experienced this degree of poor service from a hotel before in all my years of travel.",0
"One peave is that you check in and out on the second floor of the lobby. Our room was fine and we were at the end of a hall so it was very quiet. As a family """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""value"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" traveler there were a couple of things I found lacking that are pretty standard in a higher end business hotel like this: Wi-Fi costs extra and the breakfast buffet was $-- a person (needless to say we ate elsewhere). The rate we got for the hotel was pretty good for such a great location so hard to complain. It's a litte bit of a walk to the subway, but not too bad. I would definitely recommend the hotel to someone going to Chicago.",1

Yes they have bed bugs!! Stayed here recently the evening of dec --th. Everything was average until I noticed a few small bite marks on my back...I assumed mosquitoes and thought nothing of it. I slept a few hours and woke up to checkout around -am. Later on while in the car I noticed more bite marks. They became itchy and bigger than a regular mosquito bite. This morning in counted overall-- bites majority on my back and butt and a few on my arms. The worst one was on my eye lid which caused my eye to swell halfway shut.....yes they have bed bugs! Not sure if they are everywhere but defintely in room --- :-(,0

"This is a conference hotel primarily. The property is huge, so it's easy to get lost. At $-- per night parking, it's far better to take public transportation or even taxis to get around town. I love Chicago, and the hotel's location was good for walking and shopping. However, you can get around town fairly easily without having to shell out hundreds of dollars per night, plus all the overpriced extras at this hotel. The hotel has a vibrant profit center from its conference facilities, so unless you're here for a conference, it's not worth the money to stay here.",0
 We were unable to heat the room although there was a thermostat in the room with controls but it could only be used for cold air DLR line is very close and you can hear the trains early in the morning  Location is excellent and well connected Staff is friendly and helpful Room was clean and well decorated ,1

 We booked for our Milan stay in February and our stay was in late July We did not get any of our requests for either a connection room nor rooms next to each other nor even on the same floor The staff seemed reluctant to help at first but after numerous visits to the reception we finally got another room on the same floor as the kids The first room was a nightmare You would open the door and it was only a foot away from the bed Actually there was only a small distance from the bed to everything else around 2 feet  The location was next to everything as it was right next to the metro Also they provided discounted Expo tickets ,0

"This place looked promising: relatively modern exterior, nice lobby with a FedEx Kinko's and Starbucks. The room, however, was disgusting: the sheets were worn and had pilling that felt like crumbs or worse. The air conditioner barely worked. The faucet fixture was scratched and the bathroom is a very unattractive white. The remove control is ancient and vaguely sticky, and the television was a large tube-screen that just looked sad. The hotel staff is horrid: inattentive, rude, and they don't honor your requests for a particular newspaper or a high-low floor. The place is just depressing; you can just feel the conventioneers' spirits floating all over the place, their body soil in the carpets. Also, they tried to charge me for two days' use of high-speed internet that I never signed-up for; luckily I challeneged the charge. Horrid place - certainly not up to Marriott's usual standards.",0
 The F O s were not really accommodating considering that they are the frontliners The staff at the breakfast area was more friendly Location was a bit far from the heart of the city as led to believe  The room was nice very clean Breakfast was great ,0
 Value 239 for two nights and no breakfast Phones to work in bedroom  Not value for money Stayed in cheaper hotels in London better value No phones worked in bedrooms Everyday breakfast in a different location Would not recommend ,0
 It s a few kilometers from the central station so taking the tram is inevitable unless you really like to walk  It s a Ramada after all so you can expect it to be good I stayed at a 15th floor which has a really nice view Staffs were funny and helpful Shuttle bus to the airport is a plus ,1
 NOTHING I could not be any happier with a hotel than I was with the Rembrandt Everything I heard about the hotel was that it was a five star hotel in every possible way I totally agree ,1
 The thermostat sucks Too hot in my room  The hotel is good and classic ,1
 Rooms way too hot 21C is min setting Very poorly signposted Parking was 30 euros a day Good breakfast,0
No Negative I really liked the location What was a pleasant surprise was that the waiting area for the taxi was just at the corner so when I had to ask for a taxi for 5 30 in the morning there was no problem ,1
 Quality Value for money  The Club Lounge,0
 Not one complaint everything,1
 Nothing that matters Seriously good value for money A refreshing modern approach to running a hotel Hi tech all day self service cafeteria plenty of space in eating relaxing areas with friendly helpful staff ,1
 Nothing The hotel is new and really great value for money while I was on business and alone I would also recommend the hotel for couples and leisure trip While rooms are quite small they are fine and in London most of the day is spent out touring The facilities are good with basic kitchen in each room and staff were helpful and friendly while the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar this is not an issue as there are plenty within 150 meters and cafes within 50 meters for breakfast also the hotel will order in for you or you can do yourself All in all a great choice and value ,1
 room extremely small for the cost No bath floor area of bathroom was 1 metre sq No notice of my special request was taken Breakfast cost was extremely expensiveNo Positive,0
 Switched off our air con But noise in corridor from air con heating system Complained but was just told it would be reported Kept me awake most of the night No Positive,0
No Negative The breakfast scrambled eggs were like water and there was not much variety The location considering we was told was 1 4 miles from central Paris it was miles away and it was full of youths in the pavements at night were you felt very unsafe,0
 ParkingNo Positive,1
 Nothing to dislike The total combined quality of services location decoration ,1

 Bathroom shower in particular needed ripping out and redoing Bed comfy,0

 Room size cleanliness trays were left on the floor in the hallway Location,0
 nothing  everything was great Executive room so nice and spacious,1
 Reception is not smile very aggrasive I can not belive that 5 start hotel does not provide complentary water coffee fruit etc the worest 5 star hotel I have seen,0
 Room to small staff not to social and as a guest y was not feeling comfortablyNo Positive,0
 wifi a bit hard to sign on a bit slow troublesome paint on base of coffee table chipped somewhat pricey because of EXPO spacious nicely decorated modern room maybe bigger than most because it was a corner room and large modern bathroom,1
Stayed at The Drake for one night for our wedding anniversary. Were treated very well! Upgraded to a really nice Executive Suite and was surprised with free champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Great bathroom. The free Honors breakfast was excellent. Will definitely stay again.,1
 One or two of the waiting staff could have been a bit more attentive at breakfast time  Comfortable and relaxed atmosphere Good location for taxis underground and restaurants ,1
No Negative I have nothing to say except my stay was extraordinary and the staff there were friendly especially Madalina who made my stay pleasant and smooth The Montcalm hotel offered me a smart phone with internet and free international calls What a service ,1
 We booked a family room 2 adults and 2 children and we should pay extra breakfast for our 15 year old daughter wtf And for that 15 euro extra the breakfast was very poor Bathroom was quite small only one type of soap Usually a 4 star hotel offers much more Too pricey for that kind of offer Located quite far from the city center so you would travel a lot And Vienna is very crowded if you travel with your car  The only two things I liked was free parking and location near the highway because it didn t take much to exit from the city ,0
No Negative Convenient location quality breakfast excellent service from reception staff ,1
 The CR is separated from bath room  Near tourist belt ,1
No Negative The room bore no resemblance to the images on the website The decor was tired and the furniture dated ,0
 Nothing Excellent staff and accomodation,1
 Rooms were very small How well David the duty manager handled a a problem I experienced at the hotel ,1
 We booked a rather pricey double room for 2 nights We arrived at the hotel very late only to be given a room where we had open a number of fire doors walk lengthy corridors stairs up and even more stairs down Imagine all this while carrying 2 suitcases each one of us The room was clearly in a different building without a lift The walls were paper thin and we could hear those next door talking not to mention shutting their door I ll never come back  Location,0
 No night time room service for drinks Location and pool Great staff too ,1
No Negative I was sick when I stayed there and enjoyed the free film offerings ,1
"We stayed recently for a weekend, very nice accommodations. We also had the breakfast buffet included for - adults using AAA. By far the best breakfast buffet I have had at any stay. Made to order eggs, waffles and just about anything you could ask for at breakfast. They had a nice pool and spa. The lobby bar was nice and had a wall of TV's if you wanted to catch a game. Location was perfect for shopping, the Navy Pier, and local attractions. I would highly recommend this and would defiantly stay again.",1
No Negative Nice bed great location clean rooms good staff big breakfast Highly recommend,1
 Some of the cleaning could be better For example the toilet and the shower floor Also some big chairs in the lobby were dirty with big spots  Great breakfast with something for everyones taste Stylish room The location was perfect some minutes out of the worst tourist area ,1
No Negative Convenient location,1
 The manager Jeffrey and the cleaning team The back office service manager Nazmin,0
 Decoration was a cold and impersonal A guest was smoking in the non smoking rooms Sometimes only one person at frontdesk I liked the size of the room it s huge The bed was confortable The bathroom was great with a shower and a separate bath Breakfast was good too,1
 The bed was very uncomfortable I never have back ache but I felt sick in the morning because my back ached that much I told the receptionist on checking out and she said she would tell the manager but that obviously didn t make any difference to me as I had endured it for 2 nights and was checking out The changing rooms in the swimming pool were tiny And had no privacy You had to basically get ready in front of everyone which I wasn t comfortable doing as I had my 5 year old son with me and he could see everyone getting changed  The hotel its self was beautiful and had everything we could want The breakfast restaurant was extremely busy But on the second morning they opened up a separate suite which was much more relaxed ,0
 The missing items spoilt my whole experience Miss items went missing from my room,0
No Negative Didn t have breakfast ,1
 Room need renovation old fashioned Staff were not friendly NO attitude and not helpful  Choose my stay as hotel is close to venue that I have to attend meeting ,0
 Star rating doesn t match the quality saying I stay in London frequent with work wouldn t recommendNo Positive,0
 Our breakfast table was very close to those either side of us making it difficult to get to the buffet A little more space would have been appreciated The helpfulness of every staff member to whom we spoke the comfortable room and the cleanliness of the hotel ,1
"The West side of the hotel overlooks a LOUD patio bar that will keep you awake until -:-- am. The East side of the hotel overlooks the ---- where all the neighborhood gangs and homeless hang out. On either side, you'll get the NOISY street out front. It must be close to the fire station because every -- minutes a fire truck blares by.
Room was OK - but no coffee maker or hair dryer - have to trek to the lobby for ice. Parking was free, but you're parking right by where the local gangs hang out.",0
 Queuing for breakfast dirty windows and stained sofa bed  Efficient friendly staff ,1
 Rooms to clean at 1500 is a little late Walk away n showers rather than baths Bed was very good and staff very good,1
 The room is way too small and too cramp I had to remove the chair to put my luggage The room also has stairs which make it difficult to pull luggage No fridge TV is small  I like the hotel s location It is close to Paddington train station and underground train Also close to mini market Staff are friendly and helpful ,0
 Windows didn t open in the room so very hot and stuffy Location,0
 Nothing really bad Good location near public transports and only a short walk 20 min from the city center Very quiet and confortable Staff always happy to help ,1

"Just returned from - nights. The hotel is very nice and in a great location. Compared to other hotels in the area, the $-- a night rate from priceline was a great deal. I do however have to say the the staff here was one of the worst I have dealt with in all my travels. I have never seen such a pass the buck, non-caring staff at any hotel I have ever stayed. If location is all you are looking for I would recommend. However, if you are planning on assistance from the staff on any matter I would stay elsewhere.",0
 No wifi free at the room They charged the credit card for additional fee but not the room fee at the time we checked in but charged later when we checked out and were going to the the airport It s a waste of time to charge the credit card when checking out No Positive,0

 There was no kettle We didn t get the suite we asked for Baby could not get his milk warmed And despite ordering the kettle which is less than 10 pounds in the uk We got a broken one And there was no shop or ATM anywhere Fadi again from his own pocket offered me euros to get to the nearest ATM  The hotel itself and the bar Esp Fadi the bartender Really went above and beyond to redeem all the bad and turned them somewhat good,0
 Small room but that s expected in historical buildings and is not a criticism we can adapt  Magnificent linen towells and bed comfort,1
No Negative The breakfast was fantastic Lots of selection for whatever you wanted including decent North American breakfast food selection Hotel staff was friendly and helpful Room was clean and quiet despite the windows facing a busy street with bus stops right outside Great close walk to the subway station ,1
 i booked this hotel for 3 things WiFi as i am in london on business a gym so i can have a work out to start my day and location Wifi was only 20 minutes a day for free just enough time to download emails gym cost was extra i was sure when i booked it mentioned that there was a gym and no where mentioned the extra charge hotel is old and needs an upgrade bed was very old i felt the springs coming through the matress Shower was also old and very average  Location was quite good,0
 Too much noiseNo Positive,0
 Lacked personal touch Staff dont seem to care Suite not allocated in advance despite asking for 1hr early check in they had no idea when it would be ready No cloth or tea towel in kitchen No chocolates on bed or any other recognition of our Ruby wedding anniversary even though they were told in advance and on check in Bathroom sink didnt drain and not actioned when reported and not cleaned properly  Good view from suite Swimming pool and sauna good,0
 the elevator to get to the room you need to wait 15 min the floor in the room while walking barefoot is dirty feet black in 10s for a superior room there was a kitchen without equipment the price relation to quality is terrible in the shower there were hair from other customers the breakfest terrible the two sweaty guys which put each slice of salami with hands without any gloves they just used to scratch their head and wipe the floor blee the hotel is much worse than 2 years ago Nothing,0

 Lift is really too small not working sometimes and then you hardly get with your suitcase downstairsNo Positive,0
 To single beds pushed together Fell in between them twice and bathroom was dirty wooden floor was coming up would of not said a 4 star hotel  Staff were polite and good location ,0
 We had 2 fire alarms One was at 7am and one day later we had another at midnight On both occasions we had to evacuate the hotel in chilly weather and walk to a nearby hotel until the fire brigade had declared it safe While I have to applaud the staff for their safe and efficient evacuation I was disappointed by the lack of communication from management as to the reason for 2 false alarms  Early check in and late check out,1
 We arrived little bit earlier than the check in time and we had to pay a lot more than expected for early check in I asked for anniversary arrangements didn t find even one flower in the room they probably forgot I didn t feel special or they cared The room was neat and clean liked the room and the view the location is really nice close to Eiffel Tower ,1

 The bathroom not practical at all Small room but expected for Paris Location is close to station Staff very friendly,1
 Everything If you are a traditional person like me who likes a spoon to stir their morning coffee rather than a stick you will hate this hotel  Very high tec hotel The room is all controlled by an ipad The lobby reception is all self service touch screen computers to check in check out etc The breakfast are bar is like a Starbucks Trendy artwork and decor everywhere ,0
 Booked a double room was put in a twin Went to reception and complained after a lot of back and forward was moved to a double room which infact was two single beds together with a double bedding on it I was not offered any compensation and they refused when I asked the breakfast selection was terrible and was stone cold I had to ask for it to be microwaved AwfulNo Positive,0
 The room was stuffy A C did not cool sufficiently No Positive,1

 BookedTwin bedded room there was no room to separate beds appears to be a single room with extra bed View was the lift shaft Bar was non existent just a cupboard Breakfast was offered as a choice to have in room but no space to eat e g One chair no table No central lights so very dark and gloomy Very overpriced Tip stay on the other side of the seine as more is going on and wherever you are you can see the Eiffel Tower  Clenliness,0
 The bed was very uncomfortable The leisure facilities could do with an upgrade or at least a good clean The door to the sauna was broken and there were dangerous loose floor tiles Charging 4 for residents to use these facilities and 1 non refundable for the towels  Spice The Indian Restaurant The comfortable lounge sofa s and the view from the lounge ,0

 The minibar was not refilled with the same quantity as expected Laura Jesus and everyone else from the front desk were all very helpful and had very warm genuine smiles I love it Made our stay perfect The hostess at the breakfast was always very cheerful and accommodating We already planned coming back for next year,1
 Unfortunately we had to relocate rooms at 4 30am in the morning due to the lights constantly flickering we where then accommodated for the rest of our nights sleep in a lower standard room then originally booked before the upgrade The lighting issue had a very ery feel to it and didn t quite feel like it was your usual case of bad wiring I would say the hotel where very good in the solution they proposed to this problem and the complimentary afternoon tea was a nice touch Albeit if the member of staff we spoke to was adament the manage couldn t offer us any more Overall a lovely hotel with stunning decor and a brilliant location we would deffinatley stay again just not in that room O  The location of the hotel was perfect and the decor was amazing ,1

"LOCATION: Perfectly located in Union Square! Steps from shopping and restaurants. On the main cable car route. About - blocks from a metro stop.
ROOM: Got the SPG Gold upgrade to a larger room with a view of Union Square. Awesome! Room was comfortable and good bedding. An old hotel, but kept up very well. Keeps its character.
STAFF: Very helpful even with the several guests at this huge hotel.
HOTEL: Historic character is unique and felt great. Some hotels sell its age as historic. This hotels really has a great historic feeling character that is kept up well.
CITY: The city has a lot to offer. This one night stayover allowed us to enjoy the local area around Union Square. So the location was key.",1
"This hotel is in an excellent location for everything. Location is its saving grace. All else about this hotel is -star parading under unde a brand name banner. We booked - exec rooms, for some level of quiet and the access to the exec lounge services. However on arrival found exec floors were non existent, and exec lounge was a free for all at breakfast and evening canapés with management doing nothing to manage the situation. Several guests complained over the course of the week we had stayed, but only received smiles and nods. Rooms are very basic and over tired, and bathrooms not upto standard. Had to move rooms on first night as toilet wouldnt flush.Shame! Management need to wake up and get serious about customer service at this hotel.",0

 The pricing We wanted to book 2 days and the second day was going to be nearly 3x the cost of the first night I phoned the hotel and they couldn t improve on the fee so we went elsewhere for the next night That day the cost of the room dropped considerably This is not unique to your hotel but some crazy rip off system is going on with hotel pricing and needs to be more stable and regulated Also bathroom grout was grubby in places and carpets in the room were looking a bit old and used  Location Helpfulness of front desk staff Comfort of the beds,0
 the shower toilet in the room and the plasticness the people and staff,1
 All was excellent  Excellent hotel when it comes to location service cleanliness furniture bedding lobby and very generous in coffee and tea offered in lobby ,1
 The breakfast was a buffet style that s fine I quite like a buffet breakfast but in this case all the items had been left under the heat lamps for far too long meaning the fried eggs were hard and shrivelled the bacon was almost Inedible and the sausages well don t even go there  I stay in hotels quite a lot but without doubt this giant size bad was by far the most comfortable I have ever slept in Further we were given a free upgrade on arrival ,1
 Very helpeful The receptionist especially the Romanian lady was excellent,1
 Being upgraded from Duplex suite in hotel beautiful to an apartment not whats advertised Felt like a bait and switch to me  Location was awesome Easy distance to Notre Dame and many bars restaurants ,0

 The list road noise  This hotel is a little gem situated on Sloane street with a 2 min walk to Harrods Harvey nicks The dim sum afternoon tea in the Chinese restaurant is a must However ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the Rich kids do like to race their lambo s up and down Sloane street at all hours in the morning The staff are amongst the friendliest in knightsbridge ,1
 Checked in at 01 30 and only my name was correct on the check in form I then asked for a phone charger as my phone was dead They don t supply them and no staff would lend me theirs Lastly the room service breakfast card on the door still had the previous guests choices filled in I will stay at the Shard next time  The room was a nice size with a well equipped spacious en suite,0

 Staff were rude and this was such a contrast to the other two accommodations we had in Italy Also the online description included airport shuttle and we had to go to a bus stop near the train station and buy our own tickets The staff wouldn t provide any times or information about this service No Positive,0
 Really disappointed with the room and bathroom wasn t what I expected from the pictures very dated On arrival one of the staff of reception wasn t very helpful I d booked months in advance in that time my bank card had expired so had a new one she was determined to be funny about it saying she couldn t except me without the card even if I showed her my bank statement of the payment with id Other staff were helpful though  Good location with parking and easy to find ,0
 Paying tourist taxNo Positive,1
 Bad experience regarding the payment process they want to charge me the room service twice althogh i paid cash in the first time but the server denied that And they charged me by mistake the first nigth after i cancel it during the period of the free cancellation via one of the websits booking  Only The locaton,0

 bathtub had no cold water bed like a cloud,0
 Bad Drinks and expensiveNo Positive,0
 Air con didn t want to work and room was freezing We had a little heaters but it took hours by the time room was nice and warm  Hotel staff was friendly and they upgraded our room to junior suite The location is good and close to underground ,0
 Just a great stay Great stay all around,1
 The hotel is old rooms not sound isolated you can hear other customers and staff at 6am in the hallway Staff opened our room door very early in the morning without knocking Staff at the reception were not welcoming nor smiling  The location of the hotel was very convenient within a walking distance from the center The breakfast is good too and very rich ,0
 The smell in the hallway Smell and cleaning in the room I had to change the room three times The location,0
 Every thing Room far to small Stairs into room very steep and dangerous Couldn t get the cupboard as bed was right there Window didn t open Nothing,0

No Negative Location and vicinity to the city,1
 Nothing Location first class super helpful and friendly staff spot on,1
 Area but it was convenient for me hence my choosing it Comfy bed and pillows very new facilities and decor very clean Good varied breakfast,1
 Breakfast was rather poor cold baked beans leathery bacon also cold all served on cold plates really can t understand why it wasn t freshly made and served hot We ate elsewhere the next morning  The bed was comfy and had good clean sheets Bathroom was clean with soft white towels but no bath mat which seemed rather odd ,0
No Negative Very reasonably priced for area Fantastic view over London from higher floors ,1
 The wash hand basin in our bathroom had a great big crack Nothing was done even when I mentioned it to reception The bedroom and bathroom were very small had to squeeze around the bottom of the bed to get into it and hardly any room in the bathroom to sit on the toilet squashed in between the toilet roll holder and the wash had basin if you were a large person it would have been a problem Overall for the amount of money it cost to stay for two nights I was very disappointed and would never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone  The staff were very helpful Good location ,0
 small rooms location,1
 Nothing staff near the train and bus station great food in resto,1
No Negative Good easy location very easy to jump on and off the trams Rooms were spacious and spotless Beds very comfy slept extremely well Staff very friendly and helpful Would love to stay here again next time we visit Amsterdam ,1
"The staff is incredibly service and solution oriented. The location is awesome especially if you like to bike. the hotel has bikes so take advantage of them. The farmers market is steps away and the zoo is right across the street. And there is a fun roof top bar which has incredible views. 
A down side is the walls are VERY thin. This is a renovated old hotel and there is no way around the fact that you can hear EVERYTHING in the next room. The rooms are also very small. So for a short stay, the value is worth it to me. But we were there for a week and it got a bit weary.",1
 The bedroom coffee machine was rubbish A hotel of this standard should have a Nespresso machine Some of the breakfast buffet staff seemed quite disinterested and we had to wait quite a while over 30 mins for our coffees but this wouldn t put me off returning again  Go for it A large modern quality upscale yet friendly hotel at a reasonable price for London A visit to the Skybar is a must The breakfast buffet is quite nice too Excellent welcome check in bravo to the young Irish gentleman Standard rooms quite small but impeccable and well designed Ours had a view over the river and the 02 skywalk Five minutes walk from the tube line and surprisingly easy access from Gatwick airport I would recommend this to anyone ,1
 everything It was a flea pit run by staff who had no interest in being helpful Nothing,0
 There was not really anything we didn t like about the hotel it was a great hotel and we would definitely go again  I thought the hotel was very clean and welcoming Located in a great place the hotel is close to a lot of the attractions This being my 2nd visit The rooms are comfy and there is no noise from other rooms All the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much I noticed this visit some things had changed the staff acknowledged you More than the previous visit ,1
 I have already checked out and they still haven t returned my guarantee deposit  Great location and good services,0
No Negative Excellent location super friendly stuff trendy design love it,1
 No free bottled water in the room but we did at Leeds Beds soooo comfy room was big,1
 We were kept waiting for a pot of tea late at night You seemed to be understaffed and the staff on duty whilst very polite and courteous needed some training in managing customers  Georgiana Reception Desk was very professional and yet friendly at the same time She is a very good representative of your hotel ,1
No Negative Good location very nice room,1
 There was stormy weather and 9 th floor windows didn t close firmly so wind blew them open Ugly moisture stains on carpet  Comfortable rooms good breakfast friendly staff easy to access by car,1
 Food location prices  Very kind straff Not that close to center for this price By city train It took us 10 15 minutes To center too Cold to Walk Later on the trip we saw cheaper hotels closer to the centre Food not that good and very Expensive Have to say everything was expensive and that is okay If the standard would live up to It and IT takes 1 h for them to take the deposition but several days to get It back But clean nice hotel and very kind helpfull staff IT would also be fare to the customers IF Hilton hotel could inform you that you pay taxes each night that you stay we got a chock when we saw everything extra that vi had to pay,0
 however the hotel s rooms are horrible I had to change my room twice The first time because the door s lock and shower did not work and the second time because the heating system did not work in it I eventually gave up did not change the room again just changed the hotel altogether  The location is perfect and the staff is very helpful and friendly ,0
 Checkout was slow when I left Hotel has one reception desk and the customer ahead of me took ages to be served Corridor in the morning was quite loud as I was distrubed by people slaming doors and loud talking shouting Whilst the rooms and reception are very well maintained the corridors leading to the rooms are probably in need of some cosmeric redecoration at least the floor I was on floor 3 None of these criticisms however would put me of staying again which I will soon  Reception staff were very helpful and friendly both at check in and check out Reception area leaves a good first impression My room was nice large clean and was in good conditon Bed comfortable Bathroom was clean Excellent location as quite close to metro station Will come back ,1
 I had to change rooms as there was no mobile phone reception on the first floor The room looked a little tired  Staff were very helpful,1
 We had an executive room It was lovely as was the VIP Lounge which we used However the bed was terrible It sloped to one side which resulted in me sleeping on the edge of the bed all night No refund for the room was offered 275 for one night stay expecting luxury should have chosen the Premier Inn as they guarantee a good night sleep or your money back No Positive,0
 Nothing Location Location Location And comfort beds ,1
 Bar had a stale smell Lifts very small and clostraphobic Rooms very small Building work next door started early and noisy Very helpful and pleasant staff,0
 Central heating out of orderNo Positive,1
 Room was very basic which is partially understandable as its in london but cleanliness waa questionable at one point upon entering the room we saw a beetle cockroach run actoss the floor The biggest problem however was the squeaky floorboards and bed we were woken up multiple points during the night because of this and were both restless the following day as a result Will not be staying here again  Desk staff seemed pleasent location was good,0
 The we re 2 plates of half eaten food left at the bottom of the stairs when we arrived and was still there 24 hours later As per my previous visit u booked bed and continental breakfast but upon arrival this time was informed I hadn t booked for breakfast I did  the location is very good for what I needed The reception staff were very pleasant ,0
 Everything Nothing,0
"Kay was a very good host, her team and staff took us as planned and on time from the airport to the flat, we were lucky as we had access to the flat at 8am instead of 2pm. She explained everything clearly and I highly recommend her apartment, very good location in a modern district with an amazing view. We spent very good time there and will not hesitate to come back if I come by Ho Chi Minh",1
 No one took my luggage when i arrived the hotel especially when the main entrance was out of order The receptionist Ana was not friendly and she even did not check my preference and arrange me stay in Level 1 The room was absolutely good with all remote devices however the heater was somehow not working and I felt really cold at night The previous customer name was listed on the smart TV and I could see his checking details and bills This is absolutely unprofessional I can t imagine my personal details was released to strangers  Facilities are cool with smart TV and remote curtain ,0
 Our room was inside and was a view of air conditioning unit  Neighborhood was great ,1
 Very poor food from the room service For 30 the pizza and chips wasn t that great Also the showers real bad design  not much to be honest It was very airy in the entrance that was a nice feature ,0
 The hotel was too old and the room and the bathroom were not clean The bathroom was too small compared with the room size and uncomfortable I cannot hear the footsteps of the above room and the sound of running water of other rooms  The hotel location was good to access major attractions and metro station ,0
 Improve breakfast selection The staff were always ready to help ,1
 When we returned to our room late one afternoon the room had not been cleaned no reason offered Also they were reluctant to re stock the tea and coffee for some odd reason When we complained we were given 1 tea bag and 1 sachet of coffee  location was ok if you know paris,0
No Negative A fairly modern impersonal hotel 15 minutes walk from Vienna centre Ok if you don t mind walking Had a nice garden area if you wanted to sit outside The staff were helpful but I had to become a member of Marriott hotel s loyalty scheme to get free Wifi which shouldn t be necessary in this type of hotel Breakfast was good and plenty of options and staff dealt with wifi queries well ,0

 The hotel was dirty toilet had poo splashes around the rim bathroom overall was so dirty carpet was a mess dirt all over it it had a horrible smell cups to make tea and coffee were dirty I will never ever in my life go back to this so called hotel it was not worth the money The travelodge is 100 better than this place The free WiFi didn t work BTOpenzone absolutely junk I didn t even have signal in the room to use my internet on my phone or even receive calls I don t recommend Nothing,0
 Small room barely had place to move and only one side of bed had space to get up Bed was too close to the window and we could feel the cold from window we were in winter even with the heater on The hairdryer is in a drawer outside the bathroom but it s too big to fit so you have a resistance each time you want to use it And of course it cannot be unplugged outside the drawer Only one person at a time on guest wifi Location close to 3 key tube lines Clean You can take tea hot chocolate in your room For those who like it TV had many channels including one with known movies ,1
 Expensive and inconvenient parking Location,1
 Hello 01 01 2017 we stayed in your hotel My name NYCYPORENKO OLEKSANDR for all of your services I paid cash because on this day you have not worked for the terminal and gave an error on the next day But Yesterday 03 01 2017 years I have with your card the hotel will charge my credit card the amount of 26 60 euros I demand to explain to me the reason for this transaction and get my money back immediately Otherwise I will be forced through your bank to contact your bank and collect that amount Thank youNo Positive,0
 The list is so longNo Positive,0
 The hotel bar was a little loud in the room and made it hard to sleep until it closed  staff were helpful and polite but not too overbearing ,1
 bathroom a little small but that only my hubby was a big man the welcome at reception was excellent cant rem the mans name we were given warm cookies on arrival and token for free drink in bar all my requests were adhered to Very helpful in showing us where to go on our sightseeing tour and also kept our bags in storage for us ,1
 Far from the city center Very good hotel clean rooms and nice breakfast,1
 Dreadful smell in the corridor to room Smelt like a nursing home Comfortable bed,0
 As it regards the breakfast the price of 17 euro I thought I had more choice to improveregarding the breakfast could have more choice to improve They lent me the battery charger of cell phone for free I was saved ,1
 Messed up the reservation reception staff are impersonal and brusque in their manner Half of them don t seem to know what they are doing  Good location,0

 I am generally a grumpy person but I found no fault in this hotel the room was lovely the staff were very helpful and the location was exactly what we wanted  The view over the city from the 17th floor bar and the roof top terrace were amazing,1
No Negative The room has a balcony and of comfortable size People are very friendly There s a kettle in the room which is quite handy for a tea drinking person like me ,1
 Staff unaware that road works by flyover made hotel hard to find and not very helpful on phone when asked for alternative directions Kettle did not work properly had to hold switch down until boiled Comfortable Room Good parking,0
 Nothing I can say Almost everything,1
 The foot of the bed almost met the wall so the room was very small Not an issue for a short stay though as we were barely there  Location was excellent in a lovely area off Nottinghill high St The bathroom was lovely and bed comfy Lovely entrance into hotel and staff were great offering us a bottle of water on arrival ,1
 The reception staff were chewing gum as we checked in the room was booked as a club double room stating on your website a king size bed on arrival we we on the top floor of the hotel with the view blocked by a 1 2 wall outside our window the room was opposite a lift which could be heard in our room the bed was only 5 wide and wifi for our room was 10 extra The amount paid was 258 for one night which we consider very expensive for a disappointing experience was this because it was booked through Booking com I m beginning to wonder  the hotel was in a great location and the room was clean,0
 Nothing The hotel is close to all attractions and tram stations staff are really good I never has any issues with them,1
 Small bed Hotel needs renovation Location,0
No Negative Location just perfect View of Eiffel To wer superb ,1
 The room was disappointing very tired looking with dented furniture and cracked tiles in the bathroom 1 tissue only left in the tissue box and one milk carton empty and no breakfast teabags before we even started using the facilities this led me to doubt how well the room is actually prepared between guests On departure we asked a very smiley and undoubtedly friendly member of staff about express check out his knowledge of English however was very poor and he unable to understand a simple and standard hotel request which did nothing to support my previous impression of the hotel created on a visit 8 years previously  The beds were comfortable and the staff on the reception desk on arrival were friendly ,0
 But it doesn t have anything special or a lot of charm and character I wouldn t say it is a four star hotel more like a very decent three star hotel  There was nothing not to like The location isn t exactly in the old centre but it s walking distance so that was good ,0
 Expensive for the quality Not great given the price No view just a wall,0
No Negative The location of the hotel was a great location for walking to beautiful parks and the Heathrow express at Paddington station ,1
 Although the sound barrier between the rooms were very good the hallway could get loud at times I could hear the cleaning crew early and other guests running shouting  Hotel was a good value clean modern room The location was great minutes away from subway and right in front of tram line 10 minutes walking from Corso Como shops Garibaldi station This is a quiet part of town Would stay again for the price Great pistachio brioche and pastries in the downstairs cafe with coffee to stand go Italian style ,1
 Restricted parking which I found tight  The bed shower and internet ,1
 Shower was pretty small but none of us really cared Everything roof top pool and the views from the sitting area in the roof in particular,1
 our room was very small and didn t have a window it wa also extremely noisy in the morning as we were right next to the cafe area not a great deal of choice for breakfast 2 minute walk to the underground,0
 Relatively small duvet for a double bed  Excellent staff in all departments location very good and ideal for our purposes ,1
 Smell of the room Cigarette smell in the stairs corridors suspicious staff General feelingNo Positive,0
 Aircon not working in our room with 27c heat outside led to a uncomfortable nightNo Positive,0
 Bit noisy late into the night outside the hotel but hey its London  Great bar and loved the free candies and fruit infused ice water at the concierge desk ,1
"Hotel front desk has many incompetent personnel, especially late Sunday nights.
This hotel has missed crediting my frequent traveler points (SPG - Starwood Preferred Guest program) multiple times. Therefore, watch it carefully or you'll be cheated.
The SPG agents are terrible with handling the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Missing stay request"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - they will expect you to keep proving to them over and over again that they've made a mistake instead of sorting the problem out with the hotel that's creating the problem in the first place.",0
 We booked 2 nights and paid 530 euro We reserved one king size bad but got 2 singles When we got the reset we saw that actually payment for the hotel vas 180 euro but the rest was payment for BOOKING The hotel personal was surprised too 530 euro for two nights no beds like we wanted Super cold in the room No breakfast included So disappointed of booking No Positive,0
 Our room was clean but the common areas hallways seemed run down the concierge was also not the most helpful Easy to access the tube and many local sights,0
 We had a room in the 11th floor and the elevator just get to 10th floor the whole floor was made out of wood which make a sound with every step and there was a bad smell most of the timeNo Positive,0
 Small bed with low standerd pilows caused me pain in my neck the bed does not include blanket they refused to turn on the heater in the toilet and breakfast is less than standerd and I stopped eating this at last days The location and smoking policey,0

 Small and dark bedroom  Nice room for breakfast ,0
 The bathroom The staff,0
 The floor was dirty  A variety of teas and coffees given in the hotel ,0
 The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them The location the room was a little bigger for the usual London hotel room The staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel They provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic I enjoyed my stay overall,1
 breakfast menu is good but need little improvement  kind Staff Cleanness comfort near most important POI in Paris metro access free Wi Fi Secure,1

 None Excellent location,1
No Negative Weren t expecting such a nice hotel Staff were extremely friendly rooms were comfortable and clean and the breakfast was amazing All in all a great stay ,1
 Everything The room was too small the price paid for a 4 star hotel was ridiculous when you can barely swing a cat the bed sheets smelt old and the buffet breakfast was cold So much money spent on reception and landing of room levels if only the rooms were extended by 10 inches more ,0
 I had booked this hotel for my partners birthday weeks in advance I had asked them for an upgrade in room and a bigger room they reassured me that the room was going to be big when we got there the room was extremely small and they did not offer room service at night some of the staff were extremely rude never again  Nice view,0
No Negative Location was excellent but it was quite pricy for such tiny rooms with nothing more than the bear necessities ,0
 Exterior and lobby are old and borderline shabby  Perfect location for traveling by train from Padditgton and for arriving from Heathrow Room agreeable and well appointed ,0
 Having travelled with 2 grandchildren for 7 hours it wasn t surprising that they were thirsty when we arrived at our room and the 4 year old helped himself to a bottle of water which we were soon to learn had cost us a way overpriced 3 85p Have stayed in many hotels all over the world where bottled water was complimentary we were also priced out of having any meals in house ie 21 per head for breakfast was beyond the reach of us OAPS  The view from the room but we did have to pay extra for it ,0
 Expensive dinnerNo Positive,0
 The room was in dire need of maintenance The decoration was jaded the fittings have seen better days and the bed was poor mattress was lumpy and the pillows were flimsy  There were good facilities in the general area restaurants etc The staff were friendly and very helpful,0
"I was at the W Times Square for business. It is a great location for pleasure but it is very difficult to find a quiet spot or an outside cafe. My room was near the elevators and I constantly heard noise in the hallway and elevator music. I did not feel as if I had any privacy. My room was very worn with the most unacceptable issue being a stained bed skirt. I think without a renovation it is a three star at best. I paid $--- including tax, high floor and nice view, so I consider it a value. And last but certainly not least, the staff was wonderful and helpful.",0
No Negative Staff room food and location is excellent,1
 Bidet a bit close to bath making it awkward when getting out of shower  Very comfortable room and bed Good location close to station metro buses etc Everything we needed close at hand Spacious seating areas ,1
 The room is very dark since window is very small and a bit noisy since just next to elevetor hole 7th floor  Location access to the center of London ,0
No Negative Our room was lovely and clean We liked the bar outside seating area and food served up to 11pm ,1
 The extra bed was not that comfortable and the A C wasn t powerful or cold enough  Service was extremely good and the food was good The room was also quite big ,1
 The private car driver recommended by the hotel was not honest We paid him from the airport to the hotel and later he told his manager he only received 20 Paris taxi is very good we found out later and we should have had used taxi instead  It is close to Louvre and Odyssey Staff were very nice and Breakfast was really good with fresh juice and bread ,1
 It was very hot in the room Air condition was making noise all night but not cooling the rooms It is used to cool just the hotel area outside the rooms  Good location in the city centre just near subway station ,0
No Negative Well appointed boutique hotel in a hip neighborhood with easy access to central city attractions ,1
 There would be more room in a London telephone box No elevator from ground floor Noise can be an issue  Close to underground Good location,0
 Overall it could do with redecorating  The cost ,0
"The hotel and staff are great. However, because of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""over -- only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" pool parties that are held on Sundays, I would advise families with young children to stay elsewhere on Sundays. The atmosphere is truly ADULT only.",0
 The remote control of the TV was broken Some buttons didn t function but the guy from the reception desk was very kind and changed it really fast  Very good beds Perfect location near the mall and the train station Montjuic is just minutes away Metro bus are really close to the hotel You can go anywhere The road to Sagrada Familia is about one hour walking I liked the shower and the double window You hear nothing from outside Definitely I will come back here if I visit again Barcelona ,1

 Room not available at check in went back on 2 occasions still not ready Requested a bed in our room for a child in advance I was told this had not been requested I then had to show my booking as proof Bed finally put in the room staff not very helpful did not advise breakfast times where breakfast was held Not a good experience with Hilton have used numerous times in the past always had very good service However not on this occasion which was a real shame as it put a dampener on our weekend No Positive,0
 High charge for wifi View was roof of station,1
 The first day we got a mouldy room and second person in room was completely sick On first night there was a knock at 10pm on the door which we did not answer and a male member of staff then came in appeared surprised to find someone there and apologised and left  The conceige services Top of the line,0
No Negative Good breakfast attention to detail very good Staff were super friendly ,1
 The staff were fine or arrival but by no means the friendliest There is no restaurant only a bar The bar is fit for purpose but rather small and the TV was on the whole time Not a great atmosphere Cocktails over priced for the quality During our stay start of Christmas season there was a big leak in the ceiling of the bar no mention of it nor apology We ate in the hotel which is ok for a snack look elsewhere if you want really decent meal  Loved the location and bedrooms above average standard Great for a short stay But not a 4 star hotel in our opinion ,0
 no free wifi in the rooms no fridge thank you for accommodating our dog Lucy She was very happy,1
 everything was satisfactory handy bar fridge with complimentary drinks,1
 The rates were quite high But that is more a general problem in London and not specific to this Hotel I had a very pleasant stay at the Arbor Hyde Park Location is great room was big clean and very quiet Staff was very friendly ,1
 Couldn t fill kettle from bathroom tap due to design of mixer tap and restricted sink space Could not fit one of my chargers in mains socket due to overhanging shelf  Fresh new clean environment Great location Wifi access Restaurant Bar ,1
 Staff not attentive and lazy at times badly managed No real lobby and very Spartan for a 5 star property No elevator to the top level rooms  Nice classic rooms ,0
 Certain staff were very rude and messed up our check in and our whole meal when we dinned at night My husband food came after I had eaten mine My food was also wrong and then we ordered cocktails which again only came one so my husband was waiting another ten minutes for his  The bed was very comfy,0
 Subway is not too close you must walk more than 10 minutes to reach there and it is the last stop for the metro line  The beds are queen sized ,1
 The property show signs of being an older establishment It would certainly benefit greatly from a refurbishment however it was comfortable and convenient never the less  Great location easy to get to from the airport and a quick and easy trip into the city ,1
 Although parking was supposed to be free and available unfortunately that was not the case You can forget to find free parking place around hotel after 7 P M and hotel parking was always fully crowded Quality of WiFI was horrible it was not possible to use Internet at all  Nothing special ,0
 Fake eggs for breakfast DisgustingNo Positive,0
 We had an executive room which was too hot We were unable to use air con in winter and had to prop the window open with the free magazine The tv don t work on arrival but was quickly fixed The overall decor was tired and poorly finished The desk socket gave me an electric shock  Breakfast was tasty Good quality toiletries Friendly staff,0

 This is a conference hotel No customer care service This was our 3rd visit and our last The hotel has changed since it opened they only want conferences now it was our anniversary a special occassion no regard from hotel even though we were returning customers The hotel is beginning to look very tired it needs a refurb Location,0
 Layout of room was terrible Shower almost in middle of room and with glass enclosure Not an issue for couple but would be somewhat problematic for instance with older children etc A lot of European hotels have bidets next to toilet This did not Certainly a convenience that was missed Breakfast reasonable compared to other breakfast s in previous hotels in Vienna Rooftop restaurant is excellent with nice atmosphere Staff very accommodating and concierge very helpful ,1
 Overpriced average hotel Location goid,0
 Extra quilt as it was quite cold Location,1
"Its a beautiful hotel, but after spending over two hundred dollars a night, I would expect some things to be included. EVERYTHING costs extra! Plan on having some extra money budgeted, because if you want to enjoy any of the ammenities, you are going to have to pay for them. The food was the most expensive in town but really wasn't all that good. If you're looking for something to eat, I would definitely leave the hotel and try some of the local restaurants.",0
 The size of a standard double room is quite tight We were put into an extremely small one to start off but were then moved after we complained  The location was excellent if you re interested in visiting the museums The staff were very helpful and had fulfilled my special request for soya milk which was great ,1
 Very low quality price ratio for 200 euros without breakfast I would have expected much more Small room NoisyNo Positive,0
No Negative Really loved my stay in this hotel Was exactly as described and staff were just lovely especially the security staff This is a very cool hotel that perfectly encapsulates the Shoreditch vibe Would highly recommend to anyone considering staying in this area ,1
No Negative Great location Nice room,1
 The hotel is located a bit off city centre It claims to be a 4 star hotel and maybe it once was but it definitely needs a makeover Especially the rooms and the corridors Service was good but housekeeping was poor The room we got wasn t clean when we arrived and wasn n properly cleaned during our stay either Smoking is probably allowed in some rooms because the corridors reeks with stale tobacco  The hotel serves a very good breakfast the and the rooftop pool was very nice Service was good l d like to give the hotel credit for having 4 bed family rooms This is very hard to find ,0
 The lift is sooo small I and my husband and my daughter stayed at the hotel from 30 March to 6 April 2016 when we arrived at night we have shocked when we see our room because it was very small and not suitable for us as a family with many luggage but the next day we talked to Mr Carlos Nogueira who is very cooperative smart and friendly he has changed our room to another one that was more comfortable and overlooking the street the location of the hotel is more than perfect you are in the middle of Ramblas street the most famous street in Barcelona and all the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly The only disadvantages is the Internet connection it was bad and disconnected a lot and the lift is very small ,1
 this is the most expensive room we have ever booked it was a special treat as my husband has been working in england for 3 months and i live in Fuerteventura so we met up in london and we were very disappointed as the room was so small no room to move once our bags were in the room nothing like the photos extremely loud you can hear everything from the other rooms people coming and going all night long the staff should spend the night in the room to realise how loud it is in there nothing special at all in the rooms not even many toiletries a lot of money wasted as we were so looking forward to these few days together before he went off to his next job No Positive,0
 Rooms very small and in need of refurbishment  Good location within walking distance of Theatres,0
 Cleanliness Location,0
 Air conditioning after complaining twice they provided a fan Not ideal but better than no air at all Had issue over mini bar Had to ask for it to be unlocked even though we had paid the 50 Euros deposit  Comfy beds bus stop directly out front of hotel bus took 10 minutes to Centraal Station Westerpark near by great park to hang out in when you want fresh air ,0
"I was visiting SF for the second time. I therefore got the BART from the airport which stops right by the Hotel. The rooms are ok - could do with a lick of paint to brighten up - not dirty just dreary. Recognise Platinum Priority club status with good views of bay from top floor room and free breakfast. Internet connectivity provided free and good speed and connectivity. 
Can get the F line to the main attractions but does take a little time so would not reccomend for a first time visitor. 
Whilst other reviews say the homelessness is the same as other cities - it is particularly prevalent around the civic centre and i would not reccomend walkng anywhere in the area - take the excellent public transport. Because of jet lag back at the hotel before dark but would not want to be out alone after dark.",1
 Been given an old room Business centre good staff ,0
"This place does have a great view, but what it is lacking is true air conditioning. I stayed in a top floor premier room. The rate is good for San Francisco, but my stay was sheer hell as the temperature never dropped below -- Fahrenheit even with the curtains closed all day & the air conditioning (so-called) blasting on full all day. Even at dead of night when it was --F cooler outside I was still sweltering. For anyone with the slightest lack of fitness or any problems of heart or respiration I suspect this could be a mortal concern. The windows no longer open and the nice view is no good if your next holiday check-in is to the nearest hospital. I am here another two nights and hope I survive for the delight of leaving.",0
 Room is basic obviously modelled on premier inn standard if not prices  Very clean and perfectly comfortable ,1
No Negative Everything was perfect one of the best breakfast and definitely worth the money ,1
 My twin bed rolled and I had to push it against the wall to stop that Comfy bed though  The staff were helpful the view and location outstanding nespresso in room was great good value ,1
 room size the common bar and restaurant area,1
 Only downside was standing out in the cold for an hour for the fire evacuation We understand that it wasn t the hotels fault  Extremely clean really enjoyed our stay ,1
 We had made 2 special requests in our pre booking I e arrival time 9 10 00 hours and a quiet room with an extra large bed none of these requests were granted We were given a small room with a small bed and noisy air conditioning It took us 4 hours to be relocated to a decent room  Apart from the location nothing else appealed to us Your review rating of 5 4 does not reflect our views A rating of 3 would be much nearer our experience ,0
 The hallways were dark hot and smelt unclean Rooms were dated and small Website says they have air conditioning but after three room changes they did not Hot air blowing in a small stuffy room was unpleasant Restaurant served mostly Luke warm overcooked reheated food  The location was excellent Staff were pleasant ,0
 Poor phone signal in the room  Good price compared to high london prices ,1
 Worst service i ever have No Positive,0
 You get cold water when other rooms use hot water The location the service the breakfast,1

 This hotel rooms looked NOTHING like was presented in the images on Booking com The Standard double room was old and needed major renovations to achieve the false images presented on booking com Booking com presents a modern updated hotel room with modern bathroom but this was false and I could do nothing about this because I paid a NON REFUNDABLE rate  Hotel is located a few quick steps from Gloucester Road station and a short walk to Harrods Knightsbridge high street Kensington kings road Sloan Square and much more ,0
 There was not anything I was unhappy with Beds were so comfy and loved the 15th floor lounge Staff were so friendly ,1

No Negative As a family booking great to be given two rooms with adjoining doorway,1
 The staff were rude incompetent and did not listen to us They charged extra even though a refund was given they made no effort to apologise for their mistake The hotel also takes quite a long time to respond to queries Completely unprofessional given that the location is in the heart of the financial district with a lot of business customers  Only positive feedback is this was close to where we needed to be ,0
 They way you let us pay 900 euro to stay at a construction site for 4 nights I was woken up by drilling hammering the whole time I was there no warning about this at all ruined my trip it was meant to be a relaxing time off work which turned into getting no sleep for 4 nights We was rushed and kicked out the room that we paid for because the maid wanted to clean it so she could go home Maid was very rude and we felt rushed out of our own room No Positive,0

"My friend and I were very pleasantly surprised by our --day stay at the Mayflower. The room was very spacious (kitchenette, - walk in closets, a desk and - beds) and the staff was very friendly. Breakfast is basic, but has excellent baked goods and apples. While this isn't a fancy hotel, it has it's charms (old fashioned elevator) and is clean. My only complaint is that the wifi connection was nil to non-existent most of the time. But even still - it's a really good bargain hotel in the centre of San Francisco.",1
 StaffNo Positive,0
 Our room was booked as a superior double expecting nice views over the Thames but instead had a great view of an incredibly large ventilation duct Also we arrived back at our hotel on the Saturday evening and there was a party going on in the hotel but it actually felt as if the party was taking place in our room as it was so loud and there was no chance of sleeping until it was over at 1 00 am  We found the breakfast pretty lack lustre for a 4 hotel but the staff were most helpful and the setting was pleasant ,0
 Very tired hotel Dirty carpets worn furniture carpets and paintwork etc Good location,0
 Wifi was virtually impossible in my room on the 3rd floor I had to go into the corridor to download some files My room faced on to the road and was a little noisy No Positive,0
 The room was rather basic with old furniture and kind a 90 s design I expected it to be more historical a themed picture on the wall at least since the hotel promotes itself as the former guesthouse of the Habsburgs I would advise them to work a bit on this experience design I believe we were not the only once who chose this hotel based on this feature  The service was great Helpful staff prompt nice and gave helpful advice regarding parking They enabled us to check out super fast there was no need to wait in line ,0

 Nothing was a problem The staff Nacho Raul Carlos Jemma Monica and Ernest were exceptional Always smiling informative and ready to assist The bed was much larger than expected and MUCH more comfortable than expected The location was on a relatively quiet street just northeast of Placa and just East of Passeig de Gracia excellent location A good supermarket right across the street and an economical and good cafe 1 2 block south of hotel The hotel was just remodelled so everything is new and clean ,1
"The hotel and its location are fantastic !! Breakfast we ate once which was disgusting and expensive and left my wife feeling ill all day so did'nt eat there again. Found the staff very abrupt and was once asked for my room key to even borrow an umbrella when the three guys in suits in front of me were handed too without question remember don't always judge a book by its cover.
To """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Summarize"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the hotel is stunning except for the damp smelling bathroom but the staff and food let it down so wouldnt stay there again plenty of choice in New York!!",0

 The room was very simple we got the invalid room There were some scaling in some parts of the bathroom which did not give an impression of cleanliness The pictures suggest wooden floors the room had carpet which could be an issue for asthmatic people the overall state of the carpet was good my spouse is asthmatic and it was a surprise for us as we only had a couple of nights we were not too picky on this detail The guest service agent had booked us a taxi he suggested us a taxi but booked a private car with a driver to London Heathrow Airport with a fixed price of 75 but once at Heathrow we got charged 83 not a nice surprise  Location is great Breakfast is good The staff is polite and discreet WiFi works once you get proper instructions ,0

 Breakfast in the lobby  Quiet area near city center nice staff ,1
 The plastic rubber cover on the mattrass made sleeping very sweaty and uncomfortable We discovered the cover in the middle of the night and had to take it off and make the bed again Why would they spoil an excellent bed by putting a plastic cover on top of it Why not use a cotton cover to keep the mattrass clean  The Wellness centre and the pool were very nice The breakfast was super The staff very friendly and hospitable ,1
 Getting a bit past it Lot of corridor noise each night Price was OK and location Noise from train tracks at back wasn t too bad Large bar ,0
 The breakfast could have been better no so much vegetable and every morning the same food again Also it is a real pity that the hotel doesn t have a swimming pool or spa  We have already visited many 4 hotels but I must admit this one was one of the best ones We booked Junior Suite and it turned to be perfect for us Looked exactly same as on pictures It was also only 10 min by metro to the center so again very convenient People at the reception were really helpful and always answered our questions and requests If we are coming back to Milan we will definitely return to this hotel ,1

 There was no air conditioning on the ground floor and as a result was not comfortable to sit in the bar and Dining Room Floor Fans were used instead of the installed air conditioning They said the AC was in need of repair It was working just fine in our room and in the hallways of the upper floors We were there for 19 days and the AC was never on for the ground floor The hotel needs to pay more attention to detail  The food in the Dining Room was exceptional The drinks from the bar also excellent The staff for the most part was cheery and welcoming The chef was excellent but the dining room was to uncomfortable to sit in and was almost always empty The bar tender Cosomo was excellent ,1

"I am a consultant whose work has taken me across the country and into several foreign countries. In all my travels I have never experienced a more welcome atmosphere than here at this hotel. From the moment I enter the building at the beginning of my stay, I am greeted by name by their excellent staff. William, Katrina, and Amy make sure that all my needs are met. Housekeeping always does a fine job of cleaning my room and making sure the kitchen items I use are cleaned. The kitchen staff that prepares the complimentary breakfast (daily) and dinner (Mon-Thu) always have something tasty waiting for us.
I've stayed in places rated --stars and, while the decor and amenities might be more upscale, the service and the cleanliness of this hotel are as good or better than those much higher-priced hotels.",1
 Unpleasant at all Nothing,0
"It had a bed, a bathroom, television, pool and hot tub on the property. Good enough. Not the nicest hotel by far but it was located a short drive to Old Town, Gas Lamp, Fashion Center, and Balboa Park. For the location, the price was right. The pool was nice and the restaurant on the premesis served a good breakfast. I wasn't there for the luxury, just to go for a swim at night and sleep. The rooms definitely could use an update.",0

 Needed to be closer to dam square so the location wasn t great but was still easy access to public transport to get to dam square  The beds were so comfy and the shower and bath were amazing The actual rooms were really spacious ,1
 The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable Some staff were grumpy and rude Room was smaller than images shown and was not very clean hairs all over extra blanket we told the manager and he said he had changed it but still was dirty Breakfast was very poor for a 4 star hotel There was no atmosphere When we complained all the manager was concerned about was reselling the room as we wished to move  The hotel was in an easy location The look of the outside and lobby ,0
 first room was designed by a blind man nowhere to move put anything down ridiculous we changed rooms desk was very nice second room better but still weird sink so shallow water splashed everywhere no outlet by bed shower handle came off in my hand etc worst was breakfast coffee from a machine that belongs in an office super slow and tiny quantities a line developed quickly we actually skipped breakfast and went out instead  size of room was ok design was poor front desk was very nice roof deck was nice ,0
 Lifts extremely slow and this was exacerbated by one being broken for second half of stay Often had to wait 5 10 minutes for lift  Room very nice and a good size especially for price ,1
 Nothing It was all very nice  The hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the sitting room for cocktails or tea Then to the lovely breakfast room White table cloths but yet feel of informal for comfort I think this was the best breakfast Ive had in any hotel I had a bad experience in Italy before arriving I was pickpocketed and arrives in this hotel without any Credit Cards or money The staff was very helpful particularly Corrine who was able to find the proper numbers for me to have CC sent to the hotel This took much pressure off my stay They also accommodated any of my needs due to my circumstances I will stay there again and in fact plan another trip soon just to enjoy this lovely hotel ,1

 I d have liked a little more detail on the travel around from the hotel as we walked a long way from Rotherhithe Overground train in the cold when it would have been easier to go to Canary Wharf station and take the ferry across to the hotel which is free  Comfortable bed good views of the Thames from the room Great boat service to Canary Wharf once you know its there ,1
 The aircon was making a noise all the time even when turned off or could have been pipes so was abit disturbing they also had a volume block on the TV  The room and hotel was very clean Really friendly staff and good location ,1
 the only thing for us would have been closer to the west end  everything was first class we could not fault a thing the staff were so helpful especially in the dining room and bar area we would like to mention EDWIN and MICHAEL as being particularly friendly and attentive Unfortunately as we had to leave unexpectedly we did not get a chance to thank them properly ,1

 I am vegan and coeliac and except of some fruit there was no choice for breakfast They got me soya milk for breakfast next morning without any problem  The design is lovely rooms very clean and comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful It is a bit far from the center but you can take bus 22 and takes about 12 minutes to get to Central station which seems to be the core of Amsterdam ,1
 The smelling of perfume is very strong and it comes from the WC  The room is big and the bathroom is clean The receptionist is very warm hearted and helpful ,1
 Generally room furniture looks like it can be better e g foldable bed was quite worn should be about time for replacement  Location was key and Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington s location was ideal for us ,1

 If I m completely honest the bed was a little hard to our liking and we did struggle to get a good nights sleep even after walking round London all night The pillows and bedding was great just the mattress let it down I loved the location and how the hotel entrance was descreet I think the rooms are set out brilliantly and made the weekend very special what with the walk in shower speakers in the bathroom and general theme to the rooms Staff were fantastic and breakfast facility was very good,1
 Balcony rooms are a bit larger and more pleasant than the back view ones We didn t get such a room at first and per our request were moved into one after 2 days  Very clean excellent breakfast very nice rooms friendly staff,1

No Negative The bed were terribly uncomfortable we changed our room from Superior to Junior Suite in a hope we will get a more comfortable bed but the bed was the same cheap quality we could not get good night sleep You can t unpack in the superior room the closet is 41 cm 16 5 inches narrow I guess the people who designed and who approved that design are used to throwing their stuff on the floor and keeping it there The design of the superior room looks like the designer just got out of the kindergarten in love with primary colors We stayed in the hotel last year and loved it that s why we came back but it turned out that back in January the hotel underwent a renovation It was obviously done on a cheap and the main casualty was the bed comfort ,0
 Cleaner didn t knock on the door before entering at 11 15am when check out is mid day no apology received when reported to check out staff  Good location comfortable room,0

The room was surprisingly drab for such an expensive hotel, especially when compared with the beautiful lobby. Nothing really wrong, just rather dated and dull, though the housekeeping was excellent.
Breakfast in the restaurant was even more expensive than I expected, and was rather spoiled by an audible argument between two staff. 
Overall, not bad, but not good enough to make us hurry back.",0
 There were some hidden charges which were cancelled immediately when I brought it up to the front desk staff  Luxurious hotel outstanding sevices and staff,1

 The breakfast was someting you would have in 2 or 3 star hotels and it wasn t what you would expect from a 4 star hotel  The view from our room was amazing and also live music at the restaurant was perfect and singers specially the young gentleman had beautiful voice ,0
 Breakfast was very disappointing especially compared to other Mercure hotels close to the exhibition center Eggs made of powder can fruits etc Reception staff could be a bit more helpful no hotel parking and the garage that hotel worked with was full and need to park expensive in public parking Location was great with direct Trarm connection infront of the door to exhibition center comfortable bed and could even sleep with open window in Paris that was great ,0

 Although booked six months in advance they gave a first floor room with street and metro noise strangely enough everytime the metro passes the room was rambling It was supposed to be a five star hotel but there is no reception or lobby area That was very dissapointing The hotel management gives priority to outside customers for restaurants They do not make you feel special Stairs are too dimly lit hard to see your steps Breakfast area is too little and food is very poor for a five star hotel Nice terrace but no service Outside appearence is very attractive Room decoration and bathroom very modern and comfortable Centrally located excellent location,0
 No room service The reception ordered a pizza for me and I had to pick it up at the reception desk 4 stars no room service The area where the hotel is located looks quite dangerous Rooms were quite nice,1

 More help with carrying the luggages  New towels given the beds were comfortable Staff were really helpful ,1
 Wifi was a little bit on the slow side  Fabulous hotel staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly Guest rooms had lovely little touches here and there and the bathroom was marvellous the see through glass wall was interesting ,1

 Room had no air conditioning and window opened to a utility chase room was hot and stuffy TV did not work Staff insisted nothing wrong with air conditioner After a few hours and many inspections and conversations we were switched to a smaller room but much nicer window opened to the square operational air conditioner  The location was a few blocks away from the tube station and bus stop Late night grocery stores pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood Walking distance to Kensington Gardens ,0

 No slippers toothpaste or toothbrush available in room TV not working at all Reception is on 4th level and in the same building with another hotel which created some confusion when I first arrived  Good service from the staff nice breakfast ,0
 We travelled with friends and had two rooms side by side Quite a difference in the room sizes especially the bathrooms Our bathroom although beautiful was tiny you could not open the shower door great shower though unless you wedged yourself into the corner by the toilet Fine for a couple of nights but would have been a problem for a longer stay as no space to put anything  Very friendly helpful staff Great modern spotlessly clean rooms well equipped kitchens We arrived at Paddington and a very easy 8min walk to the hotel We were going to a concert in Hyde Park and again a nice easy walk perfect location for us Liked the adjoining door between our two rooms ideal for families or groups of friends Will without a doubt stay here again,1
 I was given a room for disabled people and the sink was very low which gave me a back pain every time I needed to use it also there was no curtain doors separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom which made a huge mess every time I took a shower Also there was one day that the room was not cleaned organized so I had to call them to come and do it after I came back from a long working day  Breakfast was really good Bed was comfortable Staff was very nice Excellent location from the training venue I complained about the things I did not like at the check out and they offered the food I have had during the stay for free ,0
 The only thing I didn t like was the lady behind reception didn t explain the room deposit properly to me She should have told me that if I paid with a debit card I would get my 100 deposit back within 3 5 working days I was explained this after I made the payment Beside this everything was 5 star from the moment we walked in the door What an amazing hotel all round  One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in Close to everything in London Amazing staff Amazing room I will definitely be back 100 ,1

"I recently stayed at the Four Seasons with my family. I am a picky individual and appreciate when things are done well, and done in style. My family and I received top notch service all the way... from Molly at the front desk, to PJ and Brady at the door. The room was spotless, the beds were comfortable and the food was delicious. We ate dinner and ordered breakfast from the Edge restaurant and it was sensational. Furthermore,we utilized the pool, which was also clean and enjoyable. The staff at this hotel were exceptionally accomodating and we were always given waters at the pool or on our way out the door. I cannot give a big enough """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Thank you"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to the Four Seaons, and I certainly hope to be back in the near future.",1

"This Holiday Inn Select is hardly the jewel of the chain or even in the top tier of downtown Boston hotels. Rooms were clean, service was fine (except for an -:-- a.m. Sunday knock from housekeeping seeing if we wanted our room cleaned), but the lobby, restaurant and lounge were about as interesting and busy as Nowheresville, Idaho. 
The hotel is a good walk (almost a mile) from most of the tourist areas and the -- dollar daily parking fee was unfortunately a necessity because of the dearth of parking in Boston. 
I guess for the price it was fine. Hardly a ringing endorsement.",0
No Negative I really love my stay in the hotel All staff are super Highly recommend ,1
 Requires second chair in room rather than relying on bed for the second person TV not picture not brilliant required a reset every 20 minutes or so  Very courtious staff Excellent choices of breakfast,1
 I was this time in the room 415 and unfortunately the moquette in the corridor was very dirty and even the walls had black strips It s a pity because I use this hotel at least 3 times x year Next time I will be looking for another one That management probably don t care about the carpet but the clients do  The staffs is very helpful,0

 Where can I start The staff were only interested in getting our money of us the moment we walked in other than that they were completely absent The shower was cold and dirty The chambermaid didn t clean anything The breakfast was poor quality For 255 I expected basic cleanliness and decent service didn t get either  The location is very central,0
 room size was small the stuff were very kind and helpful location good ,1
 Wifi didn t work in the room at all the TV reception was poor although it didn t really affect my stay it would others  Great location lovely breakfast nicely decorated throughout ,1
 Although it was not necessary to turn on the air conditioning at night we tried to turn it on in the afternoon and it was not working  The decision to stay in Brera was the best it could be From there we walked to various sights of MIl o besides being next to the entrance of the Metro Moscova and numerous interesting restaurants and bars Eataly is also very close Super full breakfast Great experience we still need late checkout and the staff authorized it We recommend ,1
 Tiny room Had to squeeze past between end of bed and wall to move round room No Positive,0
 Facilities overstated Pool very tired and grubby not as shown Breakfast service was appalling Poor quality food Staff dishevelled and unhelpful Food display unappealing The service no management seemed unprepared for the volume of visitors Insufficient crockery and glassware Replenishment of food offer on self serve areas was inadequate Customer service lacking I would not recommend Holiday Inn after this experience Very disappointed  Proximity to Wembley Stadium ,0

No Negative The staff are very friendly the amosphere and decoration are breathtaking the manager and owner himself took special care of us they gave us a fantastic stay we are definitely going to stay in this hotel in our next time in Milan ,1
 The bed was very hard I actually woke with neck and back ache Parking is limited I had to park else where Friendly staff very helpful,1
 Spa facilities were not open room was very basic even though we went business executive suite and also the business executive lounge just seemed a waste of money really to access Also there was no parking available  Close to Edgeware road and Camden Staff were friendly and helpful Cocktails were lovely and so was the breakfast Hotel was quite through night ,0
No Negative The hotel was of a lovely standard staff were very helpful with any questions we had We had arrived early and our room was ready which was amazing The hotel is two teams away from the centre however this suited us as we like to be away from noise and the reception were happy to tell us which stops to use and we bought tickets from there as well In fact going on the trams added to our experience,1
 it is hard to find the location is not very good the breakfast is good and room is clean,1

 Small hotel The staff are friendly ,0
 The first room that was allocated which was what was advertised But it was very suppressive with only an internal outlook which is ok for a one night business stay but in my opinion totally unsuitable for longer after two nights we were upgraded at a cost but to a much better facility the breakfast is both expensive and very ordinary  Generally good efficient service and the room was very clean The lounge bar offered a good service and was pleasant to sit in The location is ideal for all central London sight seeing ,0
 none location was good located at a convenient quartier where there are lots of food options We were given a smart phone with internet access for free for the duration of stay spacious washroom,1
 Nothing Location location and location,1
 Liked everything Excellent breakfast Hotel location perfect for Selfridges etc ,1
 That for what you got in the room I found it very expensive The Windows didn t open and it was very hot in the room even with the air con on which you couldn t tell if it was on or off  The staff were really friendly the room was very clean and tidy And that they brought breakfast up in the morning at the correct time free of charge ,0
 Air con was terrible the rooms were so warm Guy who worked at the pool bar was very unfriendly and the one lunch we had there terrible Staff at breakfast looked miserable Breakfast buffet was good Reception staff friendly,0
 Didn t like disabled bed in room tv did not work air con made a noise but no cool air you have to be under 5ft to get a decent shower d cor is dated carpet could do with a wash and if we had a superior room I would hate to think what a standard room looks like  I liked the idea of this place thinking its a 4 star hotel it made me laugh all weekend believe me it is not even a 3 star ,0
 Upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing No external view as requested even though I know not guaranteed Our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal Had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view I would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view A nice few days spent in London however would not stay at this hotel again  Good location to Waterloo station ,0
No Negative everything is good,1
 A crowded hotel  Location ,0

 Swimming pool was very cold and couldn t swim bcouse it doesn t have heater for the water the microwave inside my room was not working and it wasn t fixed I like the breakfast plus the front desk people,0
 The hotel room was very small and dingy The bathroom was old the shower barely worked as the water pressure was so bad The bed was old and very uncomfortable It was over priced for what you got The website is misleading in that is says they have a restaurant whereas they really just send you across the road to another hotel  It is in a convenient location to South Kensington tube station however that is the only positive comment I can make ,0
"Reviewed this hotel -- months ago.(Oct ----) Hotel was in bad need of a remodel then. Carpets, furniture, linens, and appliances all were dated and needed replacing. A GM from the hotel replied to my review and stated the hotel would be totally remodeled by the end of the second quarter of ----. I had originally made reservations for a different hotel and after reading the response from the GM, I cancelled and decided to stay at the newly remodeled Residence Inn agian. I was SO Looking forward to a fully remodeled hotel. On arrival the Lobby was nice & new and clean. Very nice. That's where the Disappointment began again. When we got to our room there was NO remodel. All the same OLD ugly worn out stuff!!!! ESPECIALLY the PILLOWS!!!!!!!! This Hotel STILL has ISSUES!",0

"Minutes from Rockerfeller, -th Ave & MOMA the location is great.
The hotel has a tiny, almost invisible street entrance with no real facilities downstairs.
Room service is useful as they use few diff local restaurents which gives more choice.
Room was very small and dark on -th floor & the bed was not that great compared to other hotels buts everything was clean and the free in room wifi useful.
Hurricane advice was provided but as my booking ran out & they were full I moved I needed to move elsewhere. 
Would use again for location if I could not find anywhere a bit larger, but I would look for other options first.",0

 Location wasnt great and the rooms are small The shower is horrible and the rooms are datet Plus the staff was really unfriendly Because of things that happened we wanted to change dates the Hilton Berlin Where we made reservations also wanted to help us But the Hilton vienna were really unfriendly and they couldn t care less  Breakfast was really Nice,0
 Poor wifi Very clean comfortable good location ,1
 The staff at the reception seemed not very familiar with their jobs There was often long queue at the reception Although the team indeed delivered their service with friendly attitude they could not handle the regular check in check out proceeding in an efficient and organised way Overall I felt that the hotel was understaffed and did not provide sufficient training to the employees therefore the service quality was seriously damaged  The staff at the dining area were generally friendly ,0
"Stayed at The Michelangelo in April ---- for our honeymoon. On arrival we were kindly upgraded to a Junior Suite and when we got to the room there was -- pink roses and a congratulations card - what a lovely touch!
The hotel is absolutely beautiful and our room was lovely, spacious and very clean it had everything that we needed.
There is a complimentary breakfast each morning consisting of tea-coffee and croissants-muffins-scones. All very nice and very appreciated.
If you fancy going out for breaky I would recommend the Red Flame on W--th street - a -- min walk but well worth it :-)
New York is amazing and this hotel puts you in an ideal location, it is in the heart of everything and yet is it very quiet and private.

 Housekeeping services and team are poor under beds are full of rubbish rooms are dusty and beds are way too old and worn out They upgraded me when i complained however i was not satisfied with cleaniness of the room Only 2 elevators serving the entire hotel guests staff Most of staff were trainees therefore service was poor The only advantage for this hotel is its great location in the heart of oxford street great for shopping,0
 There was an overhead rail line litrally outside my bedroom window and was running til early hours and then started again about 6ish the next morning but looked like it affected a few hotels was able to accomodate us last minute concierge was great I am on crutches and every time they saw mw they opened doors for me and made sure I was comfortable ,1

 Room we were given was in the lower ground and was not 4 star standard It was very dark and claustrophobic also the bed was very small I doubt it was a full size double As we were strapped for time I did not request another room We have stayed at this hotel a couple of times and have been happy with the rooms which is why I was so disappointed this time The breakfast was good value,0

"I stayed for a week at the standard at the beginning of November --. And at the end, they lost one of my bags in the luggage room. I have been back for - weeks now, and except for one email telling me who would be my contact, no news whatsoever about my lost luggage. For a hotel in that category, and for ---$ a night, this is unacceptable. I have sent - emails that remain unanswered. So basically my conclusion is : overpriced and don't give a damn about customers...",0
 The bar I understand that it s a boutique but with such a well stocked bar it would be nice if the bartender knew the classic cocktail menu and how to prepare cocktails formally I requested a gin martini and had to guide the bartender through the process which was ok Until the next customer requested a white Russian and he too had to provide directions and an ingredient list for his cocktail  I ve stayed in Amsterdam on several occasions and this was one of the best hotel experiences I ve ever had all around I really enjoyed a great arrival escorted to my room with just a carry on I also enjoyed the bed reminded me of the Hilton approach to bedding plush ,1
"Stayed at this hotel in September this year. Was like faulty towers. Good location, room changed twice due to stained and dirty rooms, included breakfast in dingy room to eat on our laps as no tables, food just awful. Carried all our own luggage from room to room and from Premiere to other side hello what is going on. Staff try, but purchased tickets for horse and buggy ride around central park big mistake. Went to location where helpful man told us this was for city bus tour. Back to hotel where they said oops and credited our card. Never went to breakfast again, not a great Starbucks fan but right next door to hotel and far more pleasant. Could go on takes too much energy needless to say we won't be back rooms depressing and bear no resemblance to photo's on their website.",0

 See above  The hotel us very ordinary with no wow factors considering how expensive it is compared to other 5 hotels I have stayed in I would not recommend the hotel or stay there again Not good value for English people The restaurant is expensive and the cocktails are over priced I had to send 2 bottles of wine back as the wine was off I had to upgrade to a bottle of wine that cost 66 to get a decent savignon blanc Tourist prices ,0

Went back to call room service and we were told there would be a charge to deliver two empty glasses. Finally gave up and drank the wine the next day. I have stayed here a dozen times over the years and the property has slipped to a - star at best. Not up to Westin standards. Loved the beds however.,0

 Certainly not 5 star in common sense of classification Can rate it max 4 star Compare to other experiences I stay in different hotels around he world minimum 150 days a year it is much overpriced Location convenient but isn t great Staff is very friendly and helpful but we had to remind about bottle of champagne that was included in the price three times and finally it was delivered to the room on a last day of stay so could not be used Overall filling is OK ,0

 Old hotel in need of major renovation to make it worthy of its fabulous location Total disappointment that a hotel in such a historic site was in need of update and essentially shabby Also it bills itself as a conference center but the facilities were poor Nothing worked in the way a true business professional needs them to Has the potential to be so much better but no one has bothered  Superb location in a beautiful and historic part of London ,0

"We stayed for a week and it almost felt like home for me. As my boyfriend was working, i explored the city on my own. The park's location right behind union square was great for this with loads of shops, bus routes and chinaown close by. I felt really safe to walk around and Rodel was so helpful, he had a great sollution for every question i had. The room was exactly what i wanted, clean, well appointed with a nice bathroom and plenty of space. I wasn't expecting there to be a kitchen, but this too was excellently equipped and a real bonus, as were the laundry facilities. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the park hotel to anyone, especially travellers on a budget who nevertheless maintain high standards",1
 No rooms with outside view available and then you end up without privacy in a rabbit hole Smartrooms but not all works The IPAD to steer all the equipment was broken and the staff could not get a replacement This way you end up without ways to eg control air conditioning  Commons spaces are excellent Modern with a lively feeling,0

The experience has been top-notch both times, from the initial greeting by the awesome Bellman, TJ, to the friendly and attentive check-in personnel. The rooms are extremely well appointed; I particularly enjoyed the glass rainshower and high-end toiletry products in the bath. Add to that smart wood floorboards, iPod docking station with speakers, and Keurig coffeemaker, plus an extremely comfortable bed. I will make the Dana Hotel and Spa my hotel of choice every time I visit Chicago!",1

I picked this hotel as a base to check out the bicycle routes on the west side of Austin. It had a good basic breakfast with healthy options. I choose oatmeal and fruit plus the strongest coffee I've ever had at a hotel. That's a plus in my book. Rooms were quiet and beds were comfy. hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly and even let us check out late so we could finish our bike rides and shower before checking out.,1

 For the price the room a deluxe double was a bit tatty floor stains chipped wood hairs scattered around And it was TINY but you re paying solely for location here Staff were pleasant and the room was quiet 509 but this is the second London Radisson Blu I ve stayed at and the chain seems to favour style over substance Weird music in the lifts and weird art and statues but little signage ie reception this way Wouldn t stay again usually stay at the Marrioty Canary Wharf but went to Ronnie Scott s late show and this was close by  Location was great for Soho ,0
 I booked two more days which they verbally agreed to and said it was confirmed Two hours later they told me I had to leave early as they had double booked Very poor form for any hotel let alone such a relatively expensive one An experience I have not had before in all my travels  Very clean albeit very small,0

 Poor bar area not part of the hotel proper so closed to residents by 1030pm Breakfast if extra to your room rate is expensive with cooked options charged on top Be aware this is a tourist area with little local atmosphere in the evening  Attractive building near Trafalgar Square Plenty of tourist spots in walking distance for day time visits Polite staff ,0
"We stayed at crowne plaza for our son's wedding in charlotte. I know it's an older hotel, but we didn't get any sleep because our neighbors decided to have a party. Even if the t.v was on, we heard it. We called downstairs for security, but the noise continued. I have never had this experience in a hotel before. I think crowne has no control of their guest. We couldn't wait to check out. Be aware dogs are allowed,but we never heard or smelled them. Service was just ok, and they did their best to accomadate us. There is a shuttle which will take you to a --- mi. radius. and our rooms were always clean before we came back to our rooms. The lack of sleep, however was too much. Won't stay their again.",0

 the room is too small and can bearly move no place to keep the luggage the ventilation was working only on cold air therefore they brought us a heater and having in view that the room was small the place to move became ever smaller  location is good the employees friendly,1
No Negative Hotel was located near the main attractions ie Casa Batllo Casa Perdrera Sagrada Familia La Ramblas etc Breakfast was excellent lots of choice always a great start to the day Roof top restaurant was fantastic great food great service great views Very helpful staff ,1
"In covering the ---- Big Ten Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, I had the opportunity to stay at the Red Roof Inn on the campus of Ohio State University. It was an enjoyable stay and I have no real complaints about the hotel. Despite being skeptical of the value Red Roof Inn chain, the hotel actually was decent. Both of the beds in the room were clean and made for a decent night of sleep. The bathroom was fairly small but was large enough to do what a traveler needs to do. The room has free high-speed internet, allowing travelers to get work done in the room. The hotel is close to the highway to get to downtown Columbus and also is located near several restaurants with convenient hours for most people. Overall, the stay was decent and I would stay again if I had to.",0
 as party is going on roof everyday until 1am i advice to avoid higher etages if you want to sleep earlier very fresh unformal kind of hotel rather for younger or party travelers overall spacious rooms and plenty of leisure spaces good restaurant and bar ,1
 Bar staff in roof bar were useless Only four people in the bar and two staff yet we waited 5 mins for table service before going up to bat where both continued to busy themselves by cleaning glasses for a while before I asked to be served A place to hide for lazy staff who made very poor cocktails  Only a couple of blocks from Holbon makes this hotel a great spot for a tourist stay Comfortable room and go for a higher floor as we could see most London landmarks ,0
 Carpets in corridors are dirty Aside from that the hotel was really perfect  Comfortable beds Extremely rich breakfast Close to the beach ,1
 I would expect better service in the restaurant It s indicated that you have to wait to be seated but you can wait for ages as there is nobody at the entrance almost every time  The atmosphere is unusual and energizing ,1
 The bathroom It has pine door and it is really problem to take rest inside  Location is really good It is so close to Plaza Catalunya ,1
 Only one thin pillow no others available No tea making facilities in room restaurant completely disorganised for breakfast it was do it yourself and find out yourself no assistance as to where things were Restaurant in evening chaos waited half a hour for menu no follow up with regard to dessert or coffee had to wonder around to find waiter food not great totally uninspired favourlessNo Positive,0
 The room was not as per the picture the safe did not work there was no shower and the bath tub plug did not work breakfast was poor and had no selection Overall terrible and I would not prescribe anyone to stay there Absolutely terrible all round Gbb The room was not as per the picture the safe did not work there was no shower and the bath tub plug did not work breakfast was poor and had no selection Overall terrible and I would not prescribe anyone to stay there Absolutely terrible all round ,0

 No air conditioner Bad experience in summer No Positive,0
 The bedroom is a bit too small  The location and hotel staff ,1
 Disappointed pictures looked much more spacious than the actual I could have booked at Hilton for a slightly more comfortable stay My worst experience is to have a really unclean room no details needed there  Its literally walking distance from Paddington station Loads of shops around the area ,0
 WiFi was not as good as expected for this kind of hotel I assumed it is related to the amount of guests at the time Breakfast is buff but I missed a broader selection of healthy food  Easy to reach and very comfortable room I really like the idea of having a big table which I can use as desktop during my stay ,1
 Cold ambience Very professional but nothing personnal or cozy Room was not very clean with dust on higher levels  Proximity to public transport Many restaurants nearby ,0
 Lunch items were very pricey considering it was buffet style however it wouldn t put me off staying again  Had everything you need including free water in the room fridge Room facilities were excellent ,1
 no hair dryer in the room Great location in the center and close to everything Easy to get to from Paris Nord just one easy train ride Room is small but very cute and nicely designed Wifi works Staff is friendly and helpful during check in out ,1
 The rooms are extremely basic and small I had an superior room but it certainly didn t feel like that  The location is very good and breakfast quality was pretty good Its just so busy ,0
 Small uncomfortable bed Basic bathroom Poor amenities in room Very over priced for what we got Very poor service in Ikons and Sky bar by overworked but under skilled staff  Good location,0

No Negative Great location Fast check in and check out Room was small but had all you could need and was more than enough for a solo traveller just staying a few nights Great location for an early morning trip to Heathrow as the Heatrhow Express train departs from Paddington station which is a few steps from the hotel ,1
 N A The hotel is spotless Great decor Staff very friendly Modern interior design ,1
 Room didn t have good heating system radiator in bathroom was not working When we arrived in the evening none of the perks promised via site for Genius were there if it was too late would be nice to offer them next day as matter of principle We were two and only one set of towels and bathrobe was set  Location in Navigli where most of the fun is Close to city centre and all sights Quite spacious room Good wifi Nice patio in the back of the hotel Very good breakfast ,1

No Negative So convenient for Olympia literally just round the corner ,1
No Negative Location,1
No Negative The spacious room,1
 Maintenance was a bit spotty and the space theme was dated Staff was too busy to be bothered When we checked in we asked about the airport train and were given specific information including departure times and track number That information turned out to be incorrect resulting in an adventure on the wrong train not what you want when trying to catch a plane We made it anyway  We stayed overnight for convenience while traveling It was indeed convenient The bed was wonderfully comfortable ,0
 The room size was a lil smaller than what I had expected The staff was very impressive and also the location was very convenient Also the decor was very cool n interesting ,1
 Were told before booked that we would be able to check in earlier than 2 00PM However upon arrival this was not the case and we had to pester to get one of our two rooms earlier but only by 15 minutes Poor customer service Apparently we were upgraded but the room was split level and felt very cramped Not the value for money it appeared when booking on line  Location,0
 The brasserie menu  I have stayed here many times over many years I like how I m never disappointed by the level of quality ,1
No Negative Polite staff impeccably clean great shower comfortable bed 15 min walk to sacr c ur ,1
 Nothing Breakfast was good Staffs were nice and helpful Surprised me with a simple gift and cake for my birthday Near an underground subway which is the same line with Karlzplatz and Stephansplatz ,1
 Way too expensive for the sizes of the rooms Rooms were tiny in the 1 person room the door could not even open fully because it hit the bed already way too small Does not meet the Radisson Blu quality hotel facilities also outdated stuck in the early 2000s does not even have the universal sockets in the rooms Definitely should not be using the Radisson Blu name  Location was very good tube station close by with 3 lines ,0
 Nothing to complain about except maybe the price of breakfast but that is the same in almost all hotels  Car parking at the hotel a real bonus Room was totally refurbished excellent with free water in the fridge ,1
 Would be nice to have coffee facilities in room Room size small Comfy bed and using iPad to control room is fun ,0
 I booked a room for 4 people 2 adults and my 2 kids 8 4 When I arrived I was told that I m not allowed to book a room for 4 people so I was forced to get 2 rooms even though we all stay in the same room  Nothing to be honest,0
 i was book double bed and the bed it just 2 single bed put together No Positive,0
 The room looked dated and tired The window was left open by housekeeping staff It is November and l am also thinking about the security of ourp room We were on the lower floor Poor lighting very dim Only 4 small milks left over the three days for 2 people Very old on the wall hairdryer in the bathroom Shower head was leaking  It was quiet The Sports Bar was good The food in the bar was good The No14 bus stops right outside the hotel ,0
 Room next to the lift on the ground floor when I specifically asked for a room higher up Cleanliness,1
 Room wasn t ready on arrival and when we did get in it was very very hot  Location was great for Paddington and breakfast in Garfunkels next door was great ,0
 There could have been a proper reception desk not just a couple of small stands The first impression at the entrance did not correspond to expectations And the street in front of the entrance was covered with litter perhaps because of strong wind  Breakfast for 4 was offered as en excuse for an unmade bed The staff was really friendly and helpful The location is excellent the pool facility was a great bonus ,1
 Room too small cleaning could be better Bar breakfast location,0
No Negative Good location excellent staff enjoyable food comfortable accommodation ,1
No Negative Absolutely breathtaking Everything in the hotel is beautiful and unique The rooms are very comfortable and the attention to detail is great The location is great with the metro and bus stations nearby ,1
 Nothing really found accommodation in Amsterdam generally expensive and this was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in over several weeks in Europe Also they are currently renovating and there was some noise nothing at night or early morning  Had a junior suite which worked well for us parents and 17 year old Quite spacious and comfortable beds Good location for easy walking to lots of attractions Breakfast very good We also ate one night in the hotel restaurant and although perhap a little more expensive than surrounding places was very good food and service,1
 We did not get a double room as booked on the website but a single room we got only one key and asking for one more that was the first time when the receptionist realized it is not a double room pretty ridiculous it was 1 a m and two people standing in front of his desk We had to move to a different room but still pay more Very bad service The next day they apologized and gave us a nicer room on the 6th floor No Positive,0

 Layout of room and old furniture Location,0
 Breakfast area was small Even though I slept in a sofa bed and knowing all the problems that comes with it It was actually one of the worst I have slept in There was some areas where the mattress sink due to no support Their preferred communication through email still I sent them one in the previous day to my flight asking for some information and never got a reply  Despite being already well located close to several attractions 20min walk the hotel is near two metro stations which makes it easy to move around the city It is also located near a shopping mall enough for everyone needs The apartment was well equipped the wireless internet was very good and the surrounding area was very quiet Breakfast was very good ,1
 Nothing Location service comfort,1
"I spent - days at this hotel. It looks okay in the pictures but in rality it is extremely low qaulity. I had to asks for a room with a safe as the room they gave did not have one. I was on the first floor and there was a high level of noise from the lobby. I haad to ask them to be quiet, people were so noisy. Next door to the hotel is a nightclub and we could hear the music at night. Concierge gave me wrong directions and was not very helpful. I will not stay here again.",0
No Negative I traveled around 20 centuries and stayed in more than 100 hotels but this hotel the best Every one was so very helpful wonderful The ambience of the hotel was beautiful cozy clean Great location in the heart of Paris Great location The room was beautifully decorated with a very large and comfortable bed Loved the roof top terrace The staff were very polite and obliging with helping us locate restaurants and various attractions to see and do while in paris We couldn t fault the hotel and will definitely stay there next time in Paris Thanks Mr Daniel is gentleman and friendly Marie or prinses Marie is cheerful nice and helpful this hotel the best offer in my trip,1
 More option for room service I e Cold drinks tea coffee and snacks The bed was huge and so comfortable the room view was spectacular and the bathroom was amazing Tram 13 which you can get from outside hotel takes you straight to dam square but we couldn t of asked for a better location easy to get into the hustle and bustle but can come home to peace and quite at end of night ,1
 The service was very noisy and woke me up earlyNo Positive,1
 The description of the hotel reads that it has modern decor and up to date fixtures It may be up to date relative to worn buildings in area but the rooms were dull and lifeless Cleanliness was ok lounge area good to ok Our room faced the street and it was noisy The breakfast was awful and the breakfast room drab The desk was not that helpful in answering touring questions Will not stay there again The location was good Around the corner there are several nice places a couple of bakeries pizza and good restaurant Easy to access Tube and sightseeing buses ,0
 The dirty walls and my room was not cleaned and the front desk could do nothing but offer clean towels  LocTion,0
 Personally I think the bathroom should be in a separate room but it looks very modern There was tea and coffee facilities but no milk The tv doesn t have any English channels other then the news  Hotel was gorgeous and quirky Staff were very helpful and spoke very good English Room was spacious and clean they have put in a lot of detail with the space theme It s a great location with a short walk to shops and restaurants in all directions Plus plenty of options for transport bus taxi train Would defiantly recommend and would stay again Thank you ,1

No Negative The staff were lovely and the hotel was better than we expected Lovely and spacious We arrived early in the morning and they checked us in straight away with the rooms ready and waiting ,1
 Staff are totally incompetent Faulty Towers has nothing on this place I endured a catalogue of errors including money taken from my account not once but 3 times The net result was that they totally ruined my birthday The clearly don t care because i m not the first to complain about staff competency I was also less than impressed to be staying at a hotel in London on a Saturday and being asked for my last drinks order just before midnight When I questioned why it was so early I was snapped at by the rude little man who frankly was a shade off aggressive I had another stay booked for March but I will be cancelling it  Hotel is amazing very modern and well equipped,1
No Negative Our room was a lovely size immaculate great views close to Wembley arena stadium and restraunts plenty of shops and just a pleasant stay The bed was extremely comfortable the staff were fantastic we had an amazing time We will be back,1
 Location to far from Paris centre Very noisy and staff not very friendly when asked about them putting bill on twice he said don t speak English  Nice size suite Had tea coffee facilities microwave and fridge,0
 Food was slightly expensive  Room was laid out well ,1
 The pale cups to make coffee lack for glasses for wine or champagne The understated buff breakfast and the Nescafe as a coffee was very disappointing  Despite my complain the internet connection didn t work in the room and I had to use internet in the lobby ,0
"I stayed here in April ---- with a couple of friends.
It's ideal if you're driving and on a budget as it's just off the highway, with free parking and only a couple of minutes walk to Market Square or a five-ten minute walk to the riverside.
There's a nice pool and a hot tub too.
I'm sure there are far better and more attractive hotels in San Antonio, but if you're on a budget, don't look anywhere else.",0
 I loved everything It was close to eveeything,1
"Good location and rooms were normal size, but service was below average, room was overpriced, carpet was extremely stained, maid almost walked into our room twice before checkout, no free wi-fi. We just expected more from this hotel, but it was just ok.",0
 Definitely not a four star standard There was no fridge in the room we needed to leave our baby food with the staff and then collect it when we needed it Bathroom was ridiculously small there was no space to place items near the sink We were asked to pay for the room at our arrival before even seeing it  Bed was comfortable ,0

 Nothing really Very happy with this hotel as it was close to the O2 In fact just one stop on the tube Very clean and tidy I highly recommend,1
 Dinner Terrible Inedible we were exhausted from our day and did not want to get back in the train We tried tomato soup which seemed like a chunky sauce with bits of old bread in it And a Cesar salad old And expensive There are no options close nu that I knew of  Breakfast wins at this hotel Also love the breakfast space so light and airy There was so much to choose from and who doesn t love cake at breakfast Staff was amazing at breakfast ,1

 Breakfast poor Location and Room,0
 It was too warm in the room but couldn t get the temperature lower than 23 degrees Opening a window was also not an option as their is a busy road next to the hotel which you don t really hear if you keep the windows closed  Very nice communal space to relax in the evening Spacious bright room with a great bed Also like the fact that there were sockets next to the bed so I could easily charge my phone at night without unplugging a lamp ,1
 Wificode in the room Very nice and cosy room Very clean Nice staff a bit shy but that s quite charming Excellent location close to the must do s and typical Parisien places Breakfast in your room is very luxuruous One of the best hotels I have ever seen ,1

 Tiny bathroom Air conditioner,1
 The staff at the 17th floor restaurant was a little unpleasant but maybe they were having a bad day  Staff was very friendly and nice at the front desk and they helped out as best they could with any questions you had ,1
 Room was too cold and a bit stark Would have liked a bath only a shower Corridors and ambiance were not pleasant  Great shower Good breakfast,0
 The fact they only give you two paper cups for tea for a stay of two days and don t refill your teabags coffee sachets in your tea compartment I had too ring reception to bring us new tea bags coffee sachet more bottle water for the kettle and also another glass cup which we only had one and there was two of us staying I do think if it s a 4 that should just be mandatory  The room was comfortable and the bed the showers were great plenty of hot water when needed at anytime of the day ,0
 Synthetic mix not 100 cotton sheets hard pillow tiny bedroom cheap tacky decor and like a good 3 star hotel definitely not a 5 star and prices extortionate The location,0
 Breakfast was only one choice a buffet at 22 Euros person which we considered to be too much money and food no other choice was given so we had to find breakfast elsewhere which was very inconvenient  Staff were very helpful giving us directions to bus into town ,1

"Excellent location, rooms were very nice, clean and quiet. So many things within walking distance and if we needed a taxi or directions the doormen were very polite and very friendly and most helpful!

 Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction  Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment ,1
No Negative top standard excellent service relaxing,1
No Negative The Mercure opened recently It actually coincided with the last terrorist attack in Paris so the receptionist was doubly glad to have American guests We chose the location due to its proximity to la Cigale theater and to the Metro station Pigalle which makes everything else easily accessible ,1
 We had a problem with the bathtab and the night manager didn t really try to help us solving it we were disappointed because we paid a lot for The room No Positive,0
 I think that the breakfast could have been included in the price All the comforts a rose as welcome very cozy and quiet the bathroom had everything I needed more than I needed actually The staff is super friendly and everyone speaks English fluently ,1
 Wifi was the slowest I have ever met in a hotel Speed was 0 5 1 megabytes and connection was unreliable Even the browsing the normal web pages was difficult When I reported this issue to the personnel I was told that the problem started last monday and they are waiting for the fix No refund was not offered 560 pounds for three nights stay with an unreliable internet access is not acceptable  Location is great the Earl s Court underground station was 3 5 minutes from the hotel front door From the Earl s Court station there are good connections to Heathrow and the London downtown Bed was very comfortable plenty of pillows and you could cook tea and coffee in the room ,0
"We stayed for a weekend and were disappointed. The hotel is older and the floor we stayed on is in desperate need of a makeover. The carpet in the hallway leading to our room was very stained and old looking. Bad first impressions. The carpet in the room was a ----'s gold swirl and our curtains had a large red stain on them. The bed was comfortable, though, and the room was otherwise acceptable, but we expected much better from a Hilton and for the price we paid. The location was great, but we would not stay here again.",0
No Negative Comfortable beds lovely location silent area great staff,1
 No wifi working for the first night and this is not helpful on a business trip Front desk in the morning didn t acknowledge there was an issue with wifi and this is even worse Didn t expect such service as I have had a good experience previously Once again this happens will certainly have to consider other alternatives  Centrally located convenient to get to clean and nice rooms ,0
 Temperature of the room You can t get it lower than 20 degrees but I feel the room is warmer than that  The staff are really very friendly and helpful I d like to give special mention to a couple of Desk agents David and Albert They were able to check me in early and check me out late ,1

 No complementary tea or coffee Mars bar 3 50  Excellent location,0
 Rubbishy A C we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm I would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months Appreciate that lower Windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper Windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue Location suite upgrade great staff and ease of check in,1
 The cleaning staff were very poor We were woken up at a stupid time in the morning way before we were suppose to check out then they cleaning staff still knocked on the door and hassled us 5 more times before we left We ordered a room with a double bed What we got was two single beds pushed together We wasn t very happy as they kept rolling away from each other we had to constantly push them back together during the night We selected Wembley stadium view and you had to press your face up against the window just to see the corner of the stadium Finally the bar closed very early  We loved the greeting it made us feel very welcome The hotel is in a great location ,0
 This was no fault of the hotel but the noise from theDuke of York and the club opposite the hotel was very loud As always very clean and convenient,1
 A c too noisy damp in the bathroom room needing some TLC Lifts are completely inefficient the waiting time for breakfast at peak times is a complete joke  The only good thing is the location,0

 The majority of the staff needed to smile and realise that they are paid to serve and look after their customers Chairs and tables for breakfast were dirty Pool sauna were ridiculously small Scrambled egg at breakfast was dry beyond all belief Room was too small for 2 people we spent 4 nights falling over our suitcases I had to laugh when my husband asked for an ironing board it filled the room Painting decorating including sanding happening right outside our bedroom at 8am paint smell noisy cleaners around the same time I think that s all The bathroom was half decent,0
 Teensy tiny cramped room Touted as a double maybe for an adult with a small teddy bear One chair one tiny closet No place for even one suitcase much less two and all we had were rollaboards Bed sideways against wall so inside person has to climb over outside person Calling it a double is criminal No breakfast on premises or within a few blocks Great location quiet side street a few minutes walk to earls court underground station Easy walk to museums ,0
 Entrance black washroom and shower  View,1
 I was over charged by 50 by use of pre authorised payments and only realised this the following day so frustrating having to call and try to explain how I need a refund hopefully will be refunded in next few days but and unnecessary error I believe  Location comfort and clean ,0

No Negative Great interior design absolutely amazing customer care ,1
 The hotel is situated in a quite unfriendly area and as it s a huge hotel there are crowds of guests in the hotel especially during c i or c o or breakfast which can be really uncomfortable But these are things which are not possible to change so we had a lovely time at your hotel thank s for the great service and just everything  We were surprised how big and nice the room was as it was not very expensive The staff is really friendly and helps where they can The hotel is really big but you couldn t hear any noise at night ,1
 I ordered non smoking room and the first thing i felt when i entered our room it was the strong smell of smoke Television was not working and the fridge as well I had to wait 2 days to change my room Even with a note Do not disturb staff is still unlocking the door and enetering the room Staff doesnt speak eanglish at all Pool was extreamly small no space at all for the peaple that wants to use it  breakfast was good ,0

 No bathroom door  The staff are great Dimitar in the restaurant has fantastic customer service ,1
 Couldn t get served in snack area to eat bartender washed glasses while we sat we ate all meals next door in the street bakery as did a number of guest A lot of glitz but not comfortable No lobby coffee only get coffee if you buy continental breakfast for 14 euros No extras in this place no free cookies Uptown location would be better only 1 decent restaurant close  Would not choose again Was clean good shower but no safety handle in shower to get in and out potential injury hazard room clean but no seating chair except desk Beds hard but good ,0
 Since the drainage is poor I could not use the shower I was surprised to hear drainage sound from the next room Capacity of private garage is very poor max 2 cars Public garage is 10 minutes on foot  Nothing special ,0
 There was construction and the elevator was not working The bathroom lights flickered They did not make up my room or give me fresh tea or coffee for it until I called down 2ce  They gave me a coupon for a drink of bunbly at a mearby restaurant I guess for inconvenience but they should have reduced room fees ,0

 BREAKFAST HERE I SAW THE TINIEST JUICE GLASSES  LOCATION ROOM BED,1
 1 the location is a little far from the tram stop for about 10 15 min walk and it takes about 30 minutes for tram to get to the central station 2 the room s sound insulation is not good enough cause we can hear the bathing water s sound from upstairs in the mid night and luggage pulling and dragging sound in the early morning 3 we call the sevice center at 10 30 am to inform our room need cleaning after we leave but when we arrived the room late in the night the room hadn t been cleaned during the day  wifi signal is good,0

 The bar prices where extortionate to say the least everything was over priced the staff where very rude and abrupt These points do take a lot from the over all experience of this hotel  The concierge service was very knowledgeable courteous ,0
 Staff not that friendly called us 15 minutes after the check out to remember that we have to leave I wouldn t give it 4 stars as it doesn t have a lot of facilities in the Bathroom i e only shower gel no shampoo no dental kit or shaving kit  Very good location easy to reach from the central train station Clean hotel,1

 Beer was flat every time i had a pint No Positive,1
No Negative Great location well run hotel with excellent housekeeping standards ,1
 The room was very small but maybe reasonable for that price for a hotel in paris A lot of dust in the room The room key didn t work two times when we came back to the hotel We had to run up and down 5 or 6 times because the new key cards didn t work  The bus and metro station are located just in front of the hotel Very convenient ,0

we stayed here for a day. it was a nice experience. the view is also good.",0
 The price and the space of the room but it s due to Paris central  It s next to Paris gare de lyon But it s a bit difficult to walk because the customers need to walk further to cross the tunnel ,0
 No green tea with lemon available at breakfast Breakfast limited if you do not eat bread or pastry Line of 4 young men across the front door of the hotel smoking when I came back one evening  It has character and is not standard chain product Staff at reception very helpful ,1

No Negative Clean Good location ,0
No Negative The staff is very polite and nice,1
 Rooms could be a little more up to date a little dark with dark wooden walls That it was close to everything staff were nice ,1
 The mattress was too hard and worse the pillows were too firm and much too thick to be comfortable sleeping on your side  Very recently opened hotel start of July 2016 so everything was clean and in top condition Some minor teething problems still but the friendly and service minded hotel staff is aware and we have the impression it will be taken care of Funky decoration Excellent breakfast ,1
 Reception were taking were squabbling between each other about our room the young lady said 101 but the you man said no 115 he then wrote 115 and 101 then crossed out 101 tbey had no respect for each other We settlled in to 115 to find our view was a generator or sometime We didnt take notice until we tried to sleep the noise outside the window was loud and noisey We tossed and turned for a couple of hours until the noise was unbearable We went to reception to explain abd moved us to 211 room was ok however still np view Not a happy stay Maybe the description should say room with no view  Cleanliness ,0
 WiFi was not working We had to resort to a LAN cable or to the Staff s private WiFi The dinner at the brasserie was definitely overpriced Table service was poor  Room was large bed was comfortable bathroom was good ,0
 Breakfast was not included in the room rate and cost more than my breakfast allowance so I had to skip it The view from the window was of a yard filled with rubbish bins The window was single glazing There were several air conditioning units on the next building a few metres away which gave a consistent loud hum all through the night leading to two nights of suboptimal sleep  The lobby looked nice The bed was comfortable The wifi worked well enough for my needs email and streaming ,0
 Heating system was not working in our room soft bed mattress  Location,0
 Room was very small with only a tiny window looking onto wall opposite this made the room dark and we had to have the light on even though it was sunny outside I felt claustrophobic  Excellent location,0

No Negative everything about our stay at the hotel is always delightful the staff are superb and a credit to the Doyle group,1
"The Boston Plaza was in an ideal location for shopping, siteseeing and eating. During the day we were at a conference and the Hotel had many restaurants nearby. Our conference rooms were a bit spread out and the grand ballroom was a bit dark. The staff was very courteous and helped give us suggestions for sight seeing. The Duck tour is an absolute must. I would like to return to Boston for a long weekend with my family. I would definately stay at the Plaza again.",1
No Negative If you are going to Paris this is the hotel for you Excellent facilities clean lovely staff round the corner to the metro everything you need for a brilliant visit to Paris ,1
 The doorknob was weird There was one part that detached from the doorknob The door would not close unless pulled manually looked like something is wrong Shower was not properly cleaned and there were black tracks of bacteria around the white silicon glue It would be nice to have additional blankets in the room temperature was hard to adjust Breakfast could be better 200 m from underground transportation station polite staff nice rooms nice beads decent interior of the rooms value for many great underground garage low price the neighborhood is not the best so you don t get beautiful view but for what you pay you get more than enough,1
 Long queues at reception on check in and check out with no apparent desire to address the issue Breakfast took forever to arrive in fact so long that we had to leave without eating  The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size Espresso coffee machine provided in the room was a plus,0
No Negative It was all you would expect ,1
 the shower faucet kept falling off the water went every where over the floor bathtub floor was very slippery even when we used the rubber mats My daughter did slip in the bath shower tub Had to ask for more towels on the first day because there was three guests in the room The lift was broken but it was eventually repaired we had to walk down 12 flights of stairs no problem with that but the signage saying the lift was out of order was slow coming  The beds were very comfortable even the pullout sofa bed The room was clean Plenty of teas coffee and milk but no third cup ,0
 internet was a big problemNo Positive,0
"In this hotel you are in the center of the action in NY and is very accesible by subway.Very quiet,very good service.A little expensive but very suitable.
Internet is not free but you can connect to the Times Square free wifi.Parking is $-- per night in an Icon parking at half block from hotel without in-out benefit.Remember to validate the ticket at front desk to get that special rate..To unload and load luggage you must use the space reserved in front of the hotel in the -th ave, mostly of the times is occupied so get help from the hotel employees to do it.Keep in mind that the reception is in the third floor.Main entry, which is controlled by a security person, leads to several elevators that take you the front desk in the - floor.",1
"First of all the location is great, it is - minute from the time square walking.
There is a good restaurant near the hotel in which they have a deal there, we used this deal and ate there alot.
The nearest subway is also - minutes walking from the hotel.
They have a small restaurant inside the hotel which is open between -am to -pm, has a good coffee and treatment.
We got there on night after landing in JFK, for some reason they didn't reserved our room and we had to sleep in a smoking room istead of a non one. That was the bad experience when we got there but the day after they replaced our room with a non smoking room and from then, everything went ok.",0

 The bedroom was small and dark The bathroom could not have been smaller We were put in a twin room having requested a double We were advised to book with the hotel directly next time rather than online The welcome note on the desk in the room was addressed to a different client Not a good experience for a weekend break  The location was alright ,0

 The bedroom upgrade why did the website no tell you about this  The location was as good as you would have wanted ,1
"This hotel exceeded my expectations. The location is great--three small blocks up from ferry terminal, within easy walking distance of Pioneer Market (it's longer, but still very walkable to Pike's Market) and several fun Irish Pubs right down the street. The beds were SUPER comfy, the rooms fairly small (it is an older building--quite historic), and I loved the French Press Starbucks in the room. You've GOT to try the Piroshki place right next door...unbelievable for breakfast in the room with the coffee. The staff was accommodating, friendly, and helpful. The lobby downstairs is pretty, with a fairly popular-with-the-locals happy hour, especially on Fridays after the work crowd gets off. I'd easily stay here again!",1
 They charged us 3 50 pounds to use the pool and fitness room the rooms are super small and there was no wifi for the first 2 days of our stay and when they did get wifi the connection was super slow I would not stay at a crown plaza again  the location,0

 The restaurant staff was inefficient slow and untrained Order pancakes for breakfast and they were microwave reheated and over cooked Asked the reception to find us a taxi after waiting for 20 minutes and asking 3 times of the eta of the car finally arrived a car that charged us 11GBP to go 1 mile When I told the driver that we have paid 5 GBP for the same trip he told me that it was a special service working for the hotel I was not informed when I asked them to book that it was nothing else than a black cab Very disappointing  The cozy feeling of an intimate hotel The resident cat was very cute but beware if you are allergic Towels fluffy good bed and good pillows ,0

 The TV didn t work a socket didn t have the safety cover on the magazines were out of date and only 1 soap when it was a double room But maybe that s standard in a 5 star hotel Also a socket didn t work The inner curtains had holes and the bedding had a stain  The scones were nice that were part of the afternoon tea and the staff mannerism couldn t be faulted They were great ,0
 Location was far from the town  Stuff are helpful ,0
We have just stayed at crosby for - days. What a disappointment vs thompson and mercer where we have stayed before. First we found contact lenses in glasses in the minibar (management offered us the breakfast to compensate). More important service level for this price (--- dollars the deluxe) is totally insufficient. Concierge were hardly polite in our email exchanges prior to arrival. And completely useless to book the right spots in nyc. This is the kind of hotel where you don t feel you re a guest. Just a customer. They got something wrong here. Not a goodbye when you leave. Nothing.,0
 Was unable to sleep due to faulty air conditioning unit within the room which staff were unwilling to assist or relocate The manager only got involved upon leaving the hotel and was also was not helpful and only used my negative experience as an attempt to try and get me to pay to stay again Do not stay here  Looked very nice,0

 We had a pizza in your pizzeria on the evening of April 12th The base was soggy and undercooked The toppings were tasteless Probably the worst pizza we have ever had It cost us about 10 00 which I would like refunded The marketing ploy of advertising relatively cheap accommodation i e without a window And offering an upgrade for 20 00 per night is somewhat we could have done without  It was an OK experience apart from the comments below,0

 The bathroom It was a SSS bathroom no proper separate shower toilet sink and shower all in one room There was a constant strange odor in the bathroom that made it unpleasant The room had too much furniture and it was a tight squeeze The couch was right in the walkway entrance to the room so you had to shuffle around it to get to the bed very strange layout  The breakfast nice selection of food The staff friendly helpful location internet,0

 For those light sleepers you will hear the Saint Paul Cathedral bells chiming No free breakfast as in many hotels these days and the cost of the breakfast was high for what you got  Convenient location Hop on hop off tour buses stop right in front of hotel Free coffee espresso tea and cookies in lobby lounge ,1
 After 10 days the breakfast became very boring same choices everyday Also didn t like that there was only fat free yoghurt and the fruit was fairly bland tasting would have been nice to have fried or poached eggs for a change  The location and the friendliness of the Staff who all seemed to be Spanish ,0
 The pastries at breakfast were the one weak feature Good sized room,1
 I asked for a quiet room a week in advance and was given a noisy room close to an external building which is undergoing refurbishment It started everyday 8am they could have put me in a quiet room facing another side of the hotel  Location Wifi Facilites Cleanliness ,1

Do not stay here if you will need to interact with the front desk - and don't even think of a late check out or changing your reservation. There are lots of good hotels in this neighborhood. So check all the other too.",0

No Negative The location is great It is near Passeig de Gracia train station which makes it easy to get to from airport La Rambla is a nice wallking distance away Placa de Catalunya is also easy walking distance and from there you can get city bus tour rides The rooms are nice and clean the shower and bathroom is big You have access to a nice sun lounge area and pool The staff are very friendly and welcoming I will definitely stay there again when visiting Barcelona ,1
 Too much broken stuff door lock broken kettle sink tap in a basement with claustrophobic corridors  Location,0
 Only had two days but we are going back in a month  The staff were absolutely fantastic Henri was not only incredibly helpful he recommended a perfect restaurant 5 mins from the hotel but also very amusing and charming The location was perfect we walked everywhere Surrounded by amazing boutiques restaurants theatres Jardin de Luxembourg The breakfast room was very quaint and the food delicious eggs cooked to order fruit cereals pastries baguette cheese a feast It was more like staying with friends in a beautiful home than a hotel in a big city ,1
 Only the internet The speed is terrible Excellent place with marvelous view The best staff and services you may imagine for a hotel specially Ms Laura We reserved a room for 3 persons but they gave us a large suit looking to the main Catalonia square with the same price From time to time they ask for any special services they brought regularly mineral water everything was perfect Very good breakfast Really value for money Thanks for the good management of the hotel ,1
 They have charged me 600 for Someone else s booking and still havent refunded me yet When I went to the hotel to query the general manager called the police on me Two days later I still haven t had my refund and the none of the managers have even given me a courtesy call email  Nothing Rude general manager ,0
No Negative Very convenient location 1min from stazione centrale especially if you want to visit other places by trains Clean room and friendly staff Our room was ready from the time we arrived there 11 00 in the morning ,1
 Noisy room that cannot sleep well and very small space The cleaner has mistakenly taken my own face towel to laundry so I lost my towel and there is no compensation for it  The bed is large and comfortable and the room is tidy and clean,0
 I would ve preferred if the bed and sofa were different closed rooms Also a 24 hours room service would be great  Everything location room size wifi staff it was a great hotel ,1
 See above  There was no drawers or place to put clothes Was very noisy Staff was below the window making slot of noise No concierge Not very Helpful with tourist assistance Told me to pick up one of the brochures I actually walked over to the Hilton for advice They were really very nice and helpful ,0
 The bath in the room was broken The staff gave us the option to stay or move rooms When we chose Tom move we found the room was smaller and a bit of a downgrade overlooking the air conditioning We didn t say anything more as the move had taken an hour and we were already late for dinner but it seemed like the hotel was unwilling to provide any further compromise Additionally it doesn t have the facilities or service you would expect of a 5 hotel and we were assured that there is only a view if you book a suit otherwise if you book a standard room you overlook the back of the hotel  The room was cozy but very small and the hotel was very quiet whilst still being centrally located ,0
No Negative The rooms are spacious and well done up The staff is courteous but unfriendly and non accomodative Overall good hotel just have to be very very careful with every staff member and every penny you pay ,0
 To few staff at check out Lounge on 15th floor ,1
No Negative Fab spacious room super comfy bed in a great location,1
No Negative Excellent hotel from location to extremely confortable and very clean room Breakfast is wonderful with many selections I highly recommend this hotel ,1
 The staff were not informative or helpful Our requests for quiet room were met with a placement right next to the building works of the hotel and when contacted regarding adjoining room door which meant no soundproofing no assistance given Our room also had an additional portable bed placed in it which was not requested and made the room completely small We reduced our stay from 5 to 1 night and would never return Substandard on all levelsNo Positive,0
 Room superior double was smaller than we had expected and smaller than we had elsewhere for a similar price But then again it was central London And the colour scheme was beautiful and the room quiet  Location was great the interior decoration stunning staff was friendly and caring ambience was stylish but welcoming Breakfast until 10 30 there was a good choice at the buffet and the cooked breakfast was delicious Rather late check out time added to our stress free last day ,1
 No satellite tv in rooms not good if you don t understand French and some off the reception staff sometimes pretended not to understand the English language let me down at the end when the taxi I ask them to order for me never turned up at the time I needed it PANIC set in as I had to catch flight home  only thing which was worth going to France for was the food ,0
  Yes,1
 Staff room condition Location,0
 The service so strange they allocated me to another hotel on the day afternoon before I arrive I even don t have time to cancel or book a new one besides they took a deposit 84 already When I arrive I said I don t want change the hotel the receptionist said we have no idea what hell is this service Finally the manager manage a room for me but much smaller than the pics showed on booking com  None,0
 Had to wait a very long time to check in as staff were really slow No Positive,0
"I stayed for one night and it was very pleasant. Mr Thang was a thoughtful and affable man who made me feel instantly welcomed to the residence. The room was pretty neat like the photos. The house has lots of paintings and decor, which fulfilled my aesthetic needs, haha. I love that the kitchen was fully equipped, and there was a big balcony on the top floor for me and my friend to have dinner at. Everything was clean and restocked, so I have no complaints. Would consider checking in again next time for the value and price Linh currently offers. :)",1
 Slow elevators the recepiontists are doing everything theyvare the operators the concierge everything They also dont speak english fluently nor they have all the information required by the guests I loved the staff from the ssme hotel chain but in rome Location 8 minutes walking maximum from duomo and the city center also there are alot of shops nearby room cleanness room space that it has balconies good building i would recommend to stay here for sure but be prepared for the receptionists,1
No Negative The staff were extremely helpful from warming our burritos up to making cocktails that didn t even exist Really appreciated it We weren t really in the hotel for anything other than sleeping but we did have a meal on the first day and it was lovely Would definitely stay again ,1

No Negative The location,0
 No mirror near socket for hair drying  Very comfortable bed good toiletries hairdryer tea making etc,1
 Sometimes there would be dust in the room  Location Service ,1
 For a couple there were only two pieces of coffee sugar and tea bags for an overnight stay The most inconvenient was that after having a bath the tub missed the part to release the plug to drain the water that meant we had to leave the dirty water in the tub Obviously it simply made the morning shower impossible It shouldn t have been like that  We appreciated the smoking facility inside the room the view from the heights was beautiful The room was clean bed was tidy and fresh ,0
"The room was good and the hotel is centrally located. But the restaurant is very expensive--only 
no problem if you are on expenses, which we weren't. And do not book theatres in the hotel. The idea
is good but there is a $ -- surcharge and you are not too far from the theatre area.",1
 Room is very plain and mine was in the section that had the worst view in the building overlooking the shopping mall from a low floor  Great value especially considering that the excellent breakfast buffet 30 Euros to buy by itself is included Hotel is conveniently located downtown and right next to the airport train ,1
 Noise from rambla not comfortable bed not value for money No Positive,0
No Negative Modern chic comfortable good breakfast good location,1
No Negative Really liked having the patio to relax in ,1
 After a day i would smell the sewerage kind of smell in the room Exhaust fans should be improved  The staff were very gracious and they made you feel at home ,1
 Nothing to mention The hotel is on the main street close to underground U3 and also the bus station which takes you to the city center in 7 8 minutes The shopping area Wien Mitte is also close to the hotel 10 15 min walking distance and you can find quite some shops in there It is also the main transport center to the airport S Bahn ,1
 All the reception stuff were not that friendly as expected Even we ve paid everything when checking in they were still blocking an extra warranty GBP20 night Even we ve had a voucher of GBP 40 from a previous stay we couldn t use it as they said the room had to be booked directly using their system Obviously on the voucher such conditions were not mentioned When we asked if there s any TV channel broadcasting Champions League final the answer was try zapping and see if you can find it sometimes they re doing it  Location is great wifi and complimentary coffee water were highly appreciated,0
 No newspaper despite my request My room was at the back of the building facing the school ground Very noisy in the morning Drinks at the bar overpriced  Attentive staff and good service,0
No Negative High standard and near to Palace area,1
 The air conditioning in the room made ticking noise slightly annoying The friendliest and most helpful staff I ve ever come across House keeping was very prompt in fixing the room up,1
 We booked a room for 3 people superior deluxe but instead got a single room with extra bed so it was very crowded The location is pretty far from the city center but accessible by the tram line 4  Most staff are friendly Breakfast buffet is excellent ,0
 The double bed was more like a large single The pillows had no support and should have been replaced years ago The shower needed to be descaled as it had poor enough pressure as it was Stronger fan needed in the bathroom Staff were very unhelpful towards a simple request we asked of them before we came  Very close to Earl s Court station for access Bathroom was well decorated 24 hour lobby to leave key when out for the day night ,0
 Breakfast was too few choices Room rate was bit over priced  Friendly and helpful staffs who tried very hard to explain in details in English They always directed us the easiest ways to our destinations Very humorous ,1
 Room was a little small but ok Good wifi room looks nice and was super clean Air conditioning was great and silent,1

 The Chinese restaurant is very expensive but the food served is below my expectation in relation to freshness and cooking expertise  Room comfortable staff friendly though a bit confused as to the use of the open space next to the restaurant could be used for drinks ,0
No Negative The staff was super supportive in time of our needs I was ill Clotilde and partner made arrangements for a doctor canceled my prepaid bookings and re booked a flight home On management s initiative Cristina issued a refund for the time we were not able to remain at the Grand Hotel St MIchel in Paris a totally unexpected bonus ,1
"We flew in from Sydney Australia and reserved a room for the night before. The room was comfortable but the heating and air conditioning unit was very noisy. The windows needed washing. The room was basic. The dining room, however, was a delightful surprise. We had a fantastic waiter who was attentive and pleasant. The food was better than we expected. The hotel was adequate for a stop over between flights but nothing to write home about. We will find other accommodations in the future.",0
No Negative Great location close to museums Really good breakfast,1
 1 2 lifts did not work Tv did not work even after being fixed Breakfasts not great Restaurant choices limited No warning of building work outside hotel started at 7 30 each morning central location,0
 Earlier breakfast Dinner great that it was included in the rate but it was too busy with food running out Location we need to get to the airport fairly early from Milan Central station which is opposite the hotel Helpful ness of staff Comfort room shower bed,1
 We booked a smoking room which they said was not available However housekeeping put a large ashtray so we checked if it was a smoking room They said no So why did they put it there Disappointing Lobby was not great TV channels not great  The size of the room,1
 Room cleaning service quality was inconsistent Stayed for seven nights but only once did we get wash cloths to go with the towel sets No hair conditioner ever A couple of times we weren t left with any toilet paper reserve just whatever was left of the roll on the dispenser The gym equipment was old and rusty Very tiny room and the equipment that doubled as a lat pull and rower wasn t working and never fixed during the seven nights that we were there The location was the best thing about this hotel A few steps from an underground station that was served by two lines Right next door is a grocery store and a dozen eateries within a few steps A half mile walk is a self service laundromat which we needed since we were traveling for a total of 25 days No Positive,0
 Wouldn t consider it 4 more likely 3 Don t stay here if you re young person looking to party visit red light district etc as it is quite a trek to from hotel I d know next time I go to stay more central Overall an average good hotel in Dam  Beds are comfortable Rooms are clean ,0
 Not enough staff in bar area Waited for 40 minutes to get served Bars closed at 1pm The manager must have known the hotel was full and did not resource correctly I would not stay there in future  Staff generally friendly,0
 The staff are not willing to help sincerely I have to Google everything Because they are not willing to help Veeeery small room 15 min walk to Oxford Street London Marble Arch Very big terrace,0
"The lady who checked-us in for the first night, was really nice and friendly , I think Monica, but the gentleman at the front desk ,I don't know his name but was wearing earrings, wasn't friendly at all. We decided to stay another night, but he seemed kind of , I don't know how to put this but, unprofessional and not genuine. After my interaction with him, we decided to stay in another hotel down the street. I have been working in the hotel industry ,Rooms and Divisions to be more specific, for almost -- years and I always tell my employees that empathizing is the most important thing in our job. Besides that the room was good with a microwave, fridge and a coffee machine in it and pretty spacious. Parking was free and finding a spot wasn't problem at all. I """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""might"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" stay in future.",0
 Cleaness can be improved The breakfast is nothing special also on the first day there was no place to sit in the restaurant so they asked me to sit at the bar in another room I accepted only to find out that the journey from the bar to the table were the food was placed was quite a long walk When I asked the waiter who attended at the desk to get me some help to carry the food he seemed very annoyed Not only did I do him a favour he did not do anything to help  The welcoming staff at the reception They were also very nice in explaining me how to go around Vienna ,0
 Uneven flooring in corridors No Positive,0
 Matresses were harder than I wanted Due to nearby apartments the weekend nights brought a few loud returning residents  Loved the front desk staff English speaking and great help at figuring out metro Loved location Was central to most of the attractions we wanted and Neto stations nearby ,1
 Double Superior room was smaller than a normal twin room no door to the bathroom in a double room very noisy ventilation in a bathroom poor restaurant menu TV management was very nonuser friendly Bath tube is offered but in realty the hotel does not have rooms with a bath tube City view is very poor  Nice interiors and design comfortable bed twin room was very comfortable for two guests nice continental breakfast SPA,0

 Chaos at check in room not ready got back bag had not been taken to room no to remote room so small even I was off edge of bed im only just over 5ft Couldn t move air conditioning didn t work this was meant to be a delux double Location,0
 No sound proof at all I can hear the sounds from other rooms also from the end of corridor The room and bathroom is very small The room rate was very expensive Maybe because of EXPO The breakfast wasn t as 4 star hotel The receptionists should be smile to the guests Except one of the hotel staff his name is Comar  Location since it was near of some shoppings street ,0
 most of the staff was ok except one was soo uncooperative and rough breakfast is ok for non muslims no alternative halal items elevator is soo slow the location clean,0
No Negative God location Near train station Nice rooms Ok pool and trading facilities Excellent Outdoor facilities Very good breakfast ,1
 Be warned it you re travelling by public transport there is a 10min walk from the nearest metro or tram stop to the hotel through an industrial zone This is well flagged up on the hotel website but it may present a challenge if you have a lot of luggage and the weather conditions are not ideal The directions to reach the hotel on foot are non trivial so pay careful attention to them The seating round the bar is a bit unusual not very cosy comfortable nor conducive to social mixing  The free WiFi is good e g I was able to watch Netflix Breakfast is not included and costs 20 but there is a fantastic selection of breakfast foods with many different types of freshly baked bread a highlight ,1
 It smelled something when we first got into the room Maybe it s the old carpet But I got used to the smell very soon  The location was so good that we could get Eurostar so easily ,1

 Honestly I cannot find any fault to The Chamberlain  Loved this place so much that I am going back next time I am in London Ok not super cheap but then again this is London and I have been to some seriously run down places paying this rate or more The room was beautiful the bed extra comfy and the breakfast brilliant You get a lots of freebies in the room including beer and Nespresso coffee Furthermore because it s a property owned by Fuller s there s a pub on the ground floor with a very nice menu and interesting and diverse patrons ,1
No Negative I liked everything the room services Clean place the room size and Location I m definitely staying there again in my next visit to Paris ,1
 The rooms are pretty small and simple The breakfast was ok although the coffee could have been better Additionally if you live early before 7 you can only count on packed croissant seven days type and black filter coffee  A small hotel in a vary good location next to the u bahn in the middle of old town The stuff was vary nice and helpful ,1

Hertz car rental was just a -- minute walk away. Highly recommend this hotel for a pleasant, affordable stay in the Venice area.",1

 Restaurant staff a little grumpy Great food and room service comfy bed nice bathrooms,1
 Bedroom was tired with dated furniture and decor No plugs by the bed needed an extension cable for a sleep apnoea pump but meant lead trailing dangerously across the room Price was very high for these issues Public areas are well appointed as you would expect from a hotel like this The beds are really comfortable The staff are friendly,0
 the single room is like a submarine room so small comparing with the super king size bed for one person at the novotel ca granda  very close to the center via spiga montenapleone duomo,0

 The staff from the spa does not speak any English and the facilities are not very comfortable  The beds are awesome ,1
 The etrerance to the late bar was reserved for smokers which meant that non smokers had to walk through a smelly room to get to the non smoking area When in the non smoking area the smell of smoke was obvious each time the door was opened by the waiter  Friendly welcoming staff where nothing was too much trouble All the staff were happy to in recommending place to visit and easy The breakfast was very good,1

 The bed Uncomfortable The room,0
 When we arrived rather tired after a long haul flight we were told that due to a maintenance issue the deluxe double room booked was not available They offered us a room in a sister hotel which was some distance away by taxi I was not convinced by their explanation and felt they had either double booked my room or simply sold the room on after my booking Anyway after much discussion I was allocated a room eventually The room was tiny and cramped with a shower that saturated the entire bathroom floor From my stay I would comment that the hotel is not anything approaching a 4 star I do not understand how it could have achieved such a rating  Nothing,0
 The climate control in the bedroom takes a while Food was very good Staff very friendly and helpful Great facilities Would definitely recommend This won t be my last visit,1

 I had a spa The massage was lovely I was dis appointed that the mit they gave me to wash with had a hole in it and appeared worn out I could see all the damp along the skirting whilst I was having the massage The TV in the bed room was less then basic The information led me to believe that SKY was included There was not even FREEVIEW The picture quality of the TV was terrible I had a spa The massage was lovely The staff were very helpful and polite The breakfast was very good and comfortable The bed was comfortable,0
 Underwent a renovation of the breakfast area during our stay without any prior warning The management tried to accommodate by serving in the lounge area but there was not enough room and the staff was not able to handle it We actually felt sorry for the staff that had to handle guests yelling at them  Lovely reception area Great fluffy towels On a quiet street but near many restaurants and cafes ,1
 Poor entrance to hotel Friendly staff and modern facilities,0
 No biscuits in room with coffee The bed amazing,1

 Myself and my partner went up to breakfast half an hour before it was due to close and could only get a handful of things as they were packing up annoying as we had paid The added city tax could have been mentioned at check in instead of sprung on to us at check out Each time we opened a tap it smelt of egg The prices at the skybar to eat and drink are extremely overpriced for what is offered  Everything in the hotel was exceptional The staff were very helpful and extremely friendly always had a smile on their faces ,1
 Bad rooms Bad staff A shame that this hotel has the Mercure name Way overpriced for what it is If this hotel gets to close which should happen the owners will only have what they deserve  Almost nothing,0

 The small rooms We booked a window room but were told that none were available on check in VERY small rooms you dont want to spend much time in room but in the middle of SOHO why would you Good place to rest your head for the night,1
 Hotel staff was very rude i have a genius account on booking and i benefit from early checkin which i requested and they didn t even consider it Cleanliness isn t that good even room amenities is poor and the hotel pictures look much nicer than the hotel itself  location is perfect right over metro station and taxi station View from the hotel is nice ,0

 So the problem with this hotel was that there wasn t a chance to open window and get fresh air in room this is reason I won t recommend anyone to stay there Emm nothing much I was pretty disappointed,0
 The bathroom bowl is so discusting It looks likes that s there s a hole in the ceiling The view of the Eifel Tower,0
 We think that there is a little bit expensive and you don t have many choices of restaurants or a nice view the breakfast was standard too many eggs in the menu every day poor rate quality of products in the bathroom We liked the bed and the space of the room fantastic Also the location for us was the best cause we came in Amsterdam to a concert at AFAS Live we liked the technology for coffee for room entrance for elevator bathroom etc,1
 Well I was very disappointed in the spa facilities for the fact that they was not available and I would not have booked this hotel if I was warned about this the whole point for my stay here was to take advantage of the spa and to have a relaxed time here that unfortunately did not happen and I will be taking this further as it slightly ruined my time and I was there for a relaxing time I liked the restaurant at this hotel and also the fact the staff where friendly location is also key and this was excellent,0

"I booked this hotel from internet, attracted by its location and historical backround. Not too later after my arrival, i knew this is gonna be my worst exoperience. Thye gave me a studio, with windowscould not be closed, a view to parking lot, a bathroom with really stained shower,floors with noise when walking on them,in total, this hotel sucks.for what they've charged, i think they should be sued. 
One thing I want to tell anyone who wants to stay there. THERE IS NO GREAT VIEW ON PENTHHOUSE IDURING BREAKFAST TIME AND THE ELVATOR IS SO ALOW THAT MY --YEARS GRANDMOM CAN RACE IT. This hotel is good for people looking for old fashion haunted building.",0
"Properties understandably need renovation. However, I don't understand making the customer pay premium for their renovation. 
There was No prominent employee direction, no sympathy for customers' dissatisfaction. Customers are not happy...EVERYWHERE you look.
There is No lobby...only tarps and long lines. Everywhere you go on site, another line... at Check in, elevator, concierge, cafe...etc!
Check in...-- pp in line with - attendees???
Elevator wait...- minutes...too full...waited longer to get to the --st floor...only far - elevators will get us there. Used the same - elevators for - days.
Mess everywhere...no apologies anywhere; written or otherwise.
Can't go into description about the room status. Moved - times. Called maintenance twice after placement. Too tired to move again. A-C still not operational, pits in bathtub, replaced fridge, dust hanging from a-c vents, alarm set to midnight by...
(Maintenance department awesome! They really tried...however, unable to rectify.)
Really...$--- a night?...cheaper on weekends!
Hope you enjoy a better stay...",0
I went to San diego on a buisness trip and stayed there it was a very beautiful place it does need some work to improve but I was too excited about being there to worry about the resort . The room I stayed in overlooked a pond and ducks were every where I thought that was cute seeing them swimming along. The only thing I didn't care for is at night the area is very dark and I would always have to ask one of the guys to take me to my room. There are like little bungalows and every one has there own entrance which I also liked. My room was clean and the staff were very friendly.,1

Had dinner at the hotel and food wasn't that great, but service was excellent. Before going down for dinner, we decided what we would have based on the room service menu. For whatever reason, the bar area didn't serve the same menu as the room service?? ONE BIG PROBLEM** went to leave for the marathon at -:-- a.m., hotel valet brought the car around and I got into the drivers seat..had to jump out.. HE ACTUALLY FARTED IN THE CAR..IT WAS SO GROSS AND I WAS BEYOND MAD!! It didn't go away for a long time..had to shampoo the car seat..NOT KIDDING.",1
 The room was too hot at night and the lift is slow and small  Quiet and convenient area with lots of stores and supermarket It provides easy access to most places in the city like Champs Elys es ,1
 I wanted to pay cash for my room As i had lost my credit card the day before I wasn t allowed to do so because a deposit had to be taken via a credit card I offered double the room rate as a deposit in cash but the reception staff refused even though i had called the hotel prior to my arrival to explain my situation and assured i would be able to pay cash on arrival Add this to the fact the staff were extremely rude and that we had travelled from swansea and this was xmas day needless to say we weren t impressed No Positive,0

"I've stayed in a number of hotels in this area. This time, I picked the Courtyard on I--- West, since it seemed the closest to the Lockheed facility on White Settlement Road. That was a mistake. Another Courtyard that I've stayed in, at Cityview, although a little more distant, would have been more convenient because of easier freeway access. Additionally, the West Feeway Courtyard seemed older, the lobby more cramped, the rooms smaller, and the location really unattractive. (If you stay there, make sure you ask for a room away from the freeway side, as I did. The hotel abuts a very busy freeway, and I can imagine the traffic noise would be unacceptable.)",0
 When you book a Hilton Hotel for shure you are not expecting a verry small room with a empty minibar with no bathroom spippers only one set of bathroom products for 2 people and only with one person at the reception For sure far away from wath a Hilton should provide Far away from city  Tha bathroom and the bed are ok ,0
 The property was a little far out however the metro systems are brilliant once you can work them out We felt like geniuses once we had conquered how to use them Was a little off putting the hotel down a side street but it does feel like you re in another world once you re in there We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony and if you can request one DO Beautiful views of Paris rooftops Amazing hotel I d say a little over priced for how far out you are but over all I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return should we go back to Paris No Positive,1

 The bed was really hard Might as well have slept on the floor I didn t have a decent nights sleep in the 5 nights that I stayed there The headboard and pillow was a mismatch too and made sitting up watching TV really uncomfortable Although what we had tasted nice there isn t a lot of choice for dinner in the hotel restaurant  The location was good 5 10 minute walk to Tetuan Metro station and probably a 10 15 minute walk to Arc de Triomf The breakfast had lots of choice however you would have to get down there early One day we went down around 8 45 and noticed things weren t being restocked for example the Greek yoghurt eggs and bacon Hotel was clean Staff were friendly and helpful ,0
 Deluxe single room was incredibly cramped and on the basement floor with the only window into the hallway Furnishings were new but not thoughtfully designed Sloppy service someone was still in the room when I entered after checking in the shower contained two bottles of body wash but no shampoo the safe didn t work  Great location ,0
 Our Queen Double Standard room was small not much space to move around i expected a bit bigger better room Luckily we only had a hand luggage otherwise we would ve really struggled I also was not aware of the deposit you have to pay at the desk 150 which automatically sets people back on money Then the smoking MOST people who visit Amsterdam come for the same reason like myself I was located on the 13th floor which was absolutely fine I requested a high floor for a view however I hated the fact that I had to go down 13 floors every time I wanted to smoke I had to get dressed at 2 4am whenever I wanted a fag I had to stand outside in the rain to smoke I think balconies would be a great option  Housekeeping was excellent ,0

No Negative I adored this hotel The larger room was great especially compared to the smaller rooms we had in other places in Europe We loved the wine concept It was so nice coming home after a full day and relaxing at the bar w local wine and cheese We stayed here 3 nights and I wanted a couple more It was also cool to be in the less touristic Spittelberg neighborhood where people live and hang out I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others ,1

"The upside: - blocks from the capitol, reasonable ($---) room rate, free highspeed internet, nice, clean relatively spacious interior, nice staff. The downside is that several rooms including my room (---) are in the parking garage. OK, technically, I suppose they face into the parking garage. However, everytime a car is parked its very easy to hear conversation, the car chirps, and inexplicably when a door is closed the bed actually moves as if being pushed form behind.",0

Spent one night at the Park Central. We were glad it was for only a night. The alarm clock went off at -a.m. in the room next to ours and continued until we called the front desk. The room also looked nothing like the picture that was posted on the web site. Bathroom was very clean. Can't say so much for the room. There was a big stain on the carpet along with a few huge stains on the window treatment. That really disgusted us. I guess you really do get what you pay for!,0
 We stayed 3 nights the first was in a twin room we are both size ten ladies and struggled with the thin beds you were frightened to move in case you fell out The bathroom was very small but was clean We were situated at the front of the hotel and could hear conversations at the door we were on the first floor and the window was closed The bacon was overcooked  On the second night we upgraded to a superior double room the bed was massive the room was huge the bathroom was lovely it was really quiet at the back on the third floor and it was a completely different experience so if you can afford it it would be worth upgrading ,0

It had - restaurants in same parking lot...Dennys, Wendys and Bill Millers BBQ. Another motel was next door. The waffles were good on the breakfast. That was about it.

 Hallmark Prince Regent hotel excels in setting poor standards I have never given negetive feedback about any hotel that I have book via Booking com but Hallmark Princes Regent is in a class of its own  We didn t like anything about our stay at the Hallmark Hotel Prince Regent the staff were completely unprofessional and the room that we were given didn t have a window or air conditioning meaning no natural light or ventilation ,0

 rooms are so tiny only a slim single can fit in a double bed room The so called compact double bed is hardly 1 5 m x 2 m with a plane size toilet  Helpful staff especially reception Sakina,0
 Cannot find a fault  Since it was my first time to Barcelona the staff were so helpful and friendly They organised transport to pick me up from the airport which was really good since I arrived in the evening The location of the hotel is ideal as it is accessible to so many stores landmarks etc which is within walking distance The tourist information office was five minutes away as well as the hop on and hop off buses The amenities and the breakfast was excellent I would highly recommend this hotel ,1

 We had booked a room for 4 peuple and asked via Booking for an extra bed it said on site that they were available in hotel When we arrived at the hotel we were told that it was not possible to have an extra bed the hotel admitted that they should have informed us and the only solution was to pay 660 for 2 nights for a second room more than the cost of our room for 4 We therefore had to find another hotel a bit cheaper and sleep apart as we couldn t cancel our room The deco in the hotel is cheap looking and it is in an undesirable suburb of Milan From our window we had a view of a derelict building  The room was OK but deco a bit cold ,0
 The hotel is not really luxury as I am used to It is more a 4 star Quite old  Location is awesome ,0

 We felt cheated because when we booked we requested bed and breakfast but we were denied breakfast Considering the amount of money we paid we felt really short changed by booking com and the hotel Even now we are in Frankfurt but we have also been denied breakfast through we booked through yourselves at the Aparthotel Adagio Frankfurt  It just was a normal hotel,0

The gym downstairs is adequate. Nothing to rave about. 
Slept very well here. Breakfast was pretty good. A lot more than standard Continental breakfast. 
For the cost and location, can't really beat this Comfort Inn.",1
 There wasn t any shampoo and shower gel given in the room and I went down to ask one of the staff said is in room and I said no and eventually he gave me a shampoo and a swop I just want to say I don t think a little shampoos and gel is not worth to much And also cleaner clean the room second day and still didn t give anything Overall the price and quality doesn t match  Location is perfect,0
 The bed was very hard not to my liking  The breakfast was very good Restaurant pleasant Staff friendly and helpful ,1
 Room was way too small The staffs were really sweet and helpful The room was nicely decorated in a boutique style,1
 The shower was poorly designed and water overflowed into the bathroom When we complained staff suggested rolling up a towel and putting it against the shower door It worked but clearly this is a longstanding problem A promised visit by the maintenance man failed to eventuate One of the reasons we booked the Adria was that the website lists airport shuttle We assumed this meant a shuttle is provided to Heathrow It isn t it means staff will ring you a taxi  The hotel is centrally located It s about five minutes walk from two tube stations and close to major attractions like the Natural History Museum the Victoria and Albert Museum and Hyde Park The staff were very welcoming and pleasant The hotel decor is beautiful the bed was comfortable and the air con was excellent ,1

"This is a Super -, so we did not go in with high expectations. We had read reviews that rated it really well--for a Super -. And that's exactly what it was. The room was comfortable and spacious. We stayed here because it was convenient for our purposes that weekend. The breakfast bar was fine--and free. Nothing gourmet, but it's a Super -, right? The WiFi worked really well. I even printed some documents for free. The bed was superior for any hotel--very comfortable. The staff were nice enough. I would not recommend this hotel for someone looking for an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""experience"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in their accommodations, but I would recommend it for anyone who isn't too concerned about the hotel but rather in visiting Austin.

 Breakfast range  Breakfast was mundane No poached fried eggs or omelettes Poor for the price and hotel grading More effort needed here ,0
 Arrived at the hotel after a very long plane flight over 20 hours to find that all they had was a single room available and would not let my husband stay even if I agreed to pay more money This was fashion week so there were no hotels available We were not aware of the rules in Italy not allowing for guest to stay in single rooms The hotel desk person was very rude and said there was nothing he could do and walked away The worst part was they would not refund my payment so I had to pay for 2 nights and couldn t stay at the hotel Spent another 2 hours searching for a room and had to go 30 minutes outside of town to find one No Positive,0

No Negative Henri and his entire staff were exceptionally attentive very kind and helpful my daughter and I were upgraded to a deluxe twin room with a queen sized bed original wooden beams on the walls and ceiling and a quintessential blue toile pattern on the walls and fine European linens There was a wonderful bathroom with shower and tub and a small sitting area where we could enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day It was stunningly beautiful The hotel is about 400 feet from Notre Dame and several wonderful brasseries and a Metro stop are right there as well The Louvre Touilleries and Place de Carroussell are also five minute walks Tres bien Henri and merci millefois,1
 Stair carpet was dirty and very worn in places This was the first thing you saw on arrival and gave a very poor impression Very noisy bathroom extractor fan turned itself on at 2 30am and impossible to turn off Take earplugs for the traffic noise if you are at the front of the building  Offered a room to use to change into travelling clothes when collecting my luggage from storage ,0

"We stayed in a - bed hotel room and it was the nicest hotel we've stayed in NY by far! It's in a prime location so there's lots to do in the surrounding area, and best of all it's super nice and CLEAN. Obviously since your in NY everything is narrow so you're cramped for space but it's do-able. Room came with a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Lobby is nice and has a restaurant and bar. It's honestly worth it and I'm so glad we found this place. I highly recommend staying here.",1
 The stuff was nice but doesn t seemed to get a well treated introduction they felted often uncoordinated But they were always friendly I think the hotel need to school their stuff better  Breakfast was ok But the spark was not there,0

"I stayed at the Constitution Inn for a week and found the location to be very centrally located; The rooms and facility are old, but you have all the basics. The heating system doesn't appear to be up to date, so you may experience a very warm room. But all in all I like the location, the fitness facility and walking distance to a few eateries. Also the price is good compared to other hotels in the Boston area especially during the fall.",0

 I phoned up the W12 Apartments prior to the trip to inform them that although I had booked it it was my wife and 2 daughters who would be arriving They said that was no problem but when they turned up they insisted I would have to supply ID and this was frustrating as I could have supplied them with it prior to my wife arriving The location for the Shepherds Bush Concert was excellent ,0
 Standard of the room and bathroom was that of a 2 star hotel and not 4  Location was convenient for me and the entrance is relatively pleasant ,0
 No air conditioning despite the rooms being sweltering Too noisy in the night to have windows open as located on a main road Walls are very thin and you can constantly hear other people including every time they go to the bathroom I appreciate it wasn t the most expensive room in the hotel but for 4 you expect tea and coffee making facilities Very disappointed  It was very clean and the wifi was great ,0

 N A The staff were very friendly Room was spacious Breakfast was amazing Room service was prompt and food was delicious,1
 A common microwave between some rooms or at the floor would be helpful In case of international travelers like me who fly across continents the hotel may consider giving a free delayed check out until 4 PM The room was large and comfortable with a good view and natural light It is located in central London surrounded by many beautiful parks that one must visit and enjoy ,1
 The bedroom was in the basement No light and ridiculously small To make matters worse the bed was super uncomfortable and made a lot of noise We checked in at 1 am then left by 5 am  Location was good right by earls court station,0

The front desk and valet staff were very friendly and always made sure they welcomed me back at the end of the day. The mini kitchen was a plus. We had one issue with service in the pool area, but they made amends immediately and were so apologetic that I would still rate them as excellent. My room was at the end of the hall and was so quiet! I would definitely stay there again.",1

 The single room was very small and extremely hot making sleeping difficult I had to change my booking on a non refundable rate and whilst allowing me to change to another date I was charged 50 more despite my reason for change was an unexpected hospital appointment for my wife s cancer seemed mean to me Allowing the date change at the same rate was all I was asking  Location was fine,0

 This property is way overpriced for what you get especially the breakfast One of the front desk managers completely darkened our whole stay there She was particularly rude and sarcastic Regarding some travel problems we were having she offered no solution Literally talked back to me Did not even treat me with basic sensitivity nor as a customer whose satisfaction was important She seemed to have no regard for the fact that she herself is a public representative of the Hilton but rather she acted as though she was doing me a favor by just being there even there are 100s of hotels to choose from I will never go back there or recommend this property and I may never choose Hilton again because of Giulya over all the staff were nice and the property is clean,0

The bathroom needs better ventilation. I came out from my shower needing another shower just from sweating.
There was not a lot of closet space but otherwise the room was nice and the bed very comfortable.
The exercise room needs some serious upgrading. The pool area was very nice.
Two computers were available in the lobby but were always occupied.
The free shuttle to and from the airport was convenient and I did not have a long wait.

No Negative Triple rooms with separate annex for third bed was great,1
 Small bed Rash from linen and hand soap  Nothing ,0
 Using the security card to get to your floor in the lift always required a deft touch It made for some friendly interaction with fellow guests but was also stressful as sometimes the card did not activate and the lift would have already gone past your floor  The breakfast selection was very good While the hotel is very centrally located my room was very quiet and I enjoyed two good nights of sleep Staff were always friendly and very helpful ,1
 Rooms are extremely small Bar cold and uninviting with hard seats and loud music more a thoroughfare than a bar Location and Excellent breakfast,0
"The Hay Adams is in an ideal location for families visiting DC. However, for business travelers, there are many better choices. During my stay, there were several large groups staying as well and the hotel staff was completely overwhelmed. Room service would show up -- to -- minutes after the promised time and only after multiple calls. There is no gym. As for the rooms, they are small and many have no view and little natural light (i.e., they face a brick wall or other office buildings that are only several feet away). The desks are small and the chairs were selected for form rather than function so that the working environment is not pleasant.",0
 The check in Too long of a wait Staff didn t follow through the requests Didn t like the room had to be changed Bathroom didn t have have a magnifying mirror lighting was bad Dirty glasses not picked up Elevator cards didn t work most of the time  Location Adequate breakfast Complimentary executive lounge by Cynthia the receptionist ,0

 The Turkish bath could have been just a touch warmer  Rooms were extra plush and cozy We loved the view from our balcony It made for great people watching in the morning The pillows on the bed were especially cushy It felt like we were melting into the bed every night I also loved the little night time treat that they left for us ,1
"If you are looking for the usual Holiday Inn Express experience, you will be satisfied with this one. A good value considering location, room decor, comfort, and services provided. If you want to be a bit closer to the action (Times Square), a larger room, and more services, you need to stay elsewhere.",0

"We had stayed here -- years ago and really liked it. This time, we found a tired hotel in serious need of renovations and greater attention to cleanliness. In our room we found an old band-aid stuck to a hairpin stuck to the carpet. The carpet itself was stained and frayed. The couch was stained and the furniture was scratched up. The bedside lamp didn't work. The bathroom was OK, but looked like it hadn't been updated in decades. We switched rooms for our second night; it was better, cleaner, but still a bit dilapidated with old stained carpet. On the plus side, the staff was uniformly friendly. The head of house-keeping came immediately and disposed of the band-aid. Dario at the front desk found us a different room the next day. The valets were very friendly and helpful.",0
 Bathroom less dusty and a bit cleaner would be good air conditioning not working although changed to another room with good air conditioning but a constant machinery drone In the second room shower leaked water over the side of bath On the whole not that great I suspect living on past history of the name  The staff were very nice everything else was very average,0
 The hotel is a bit outdated the fitness center would need more space and newer machines the staff is nice but not very experienced left the laundry at the reception and they forgot to tell me that there was no laundry that day and they return my clothes at check out the day after I dropped them off dirty a message in the room would have been a nice touch In a calm area of Barcelona nice little pool on the second floor ,0
 The sink in the bathroom was not draining properly I asked someone to come and look and nobody came besides being promised it will be looked at  The room was spacious though the outside scenery was not great Loved having the Spa at the hotel ,1
 The pool was much smaller than we expected  The room was clean ,1
 We had an upgrade on the room and was quoted the price but when we came to pay the price was increased supposedly because of local taxes It would have been more honest to give the right price when we were offered the upgrade  The hotel was on a good bus route for the centre The room was comfortable and well appointed It was reasonably quiet The room was very clean,1
 The massage was the worst I had in my life New clean hotel and great staff Close to every attraction in Paris Provides free bicycles for us Beautiful hotel,1
 nothing specific it is ok hotel swimming pool cool atmosphere ,0
 Noise and cleanliness Worst hotel experience ever,0
 nothing set in centre of city perfect location,1
 Shower room leaked water into the bedroom as the floor drainage wasn t appropriate Previous occupants had got the carpet wet which wouldn t be difficult You need to shower in minutes to prevent water seeping into the bedroom  Hotel was in easy access of Paddington station Quick and easy check in Room was ready upon arrival ,0
Stayed for - nights in November (yes this review is long overdue!) with my sister to celebrate her --th birthday. It is a lovely hotel with wonderfully attentive staff. Our room was lovely and spacious by NY standards and the beds so comfy it was hard to get up in the morning! The continental breakfast was a real bonus as was the lounge on the first floor which meant we could have a nice cup of tea whilst setting up and using our newly purchased iPads. My only slight criticism would be the lack of lighting in the room - we were on the --th floor overlooking the street but the room was still a little dark. Would definitely stay here again.,1
 Rooms on the first floor do not have air conditioning Our rooms were unbearably hot Breakfast was poor  Good location a short walk from the shops restaurant and public transport of canary wharf ,0
 Breakfast only ate there once stayed for 5 days though It s like a huge loud cafeteria where you sit in rows no privacy as your right next to each other Food not the best either They also recommended a restaurant to us which was just awful 4 other couples were also there from Tryp at the same time as us One couple walked out The other two complained about the food Wonder why it kept being recommended  Struggling to think really ,0
 I stayed here for business 2 nights purely because the hotel is connected to the conference centre It is the most soul less hotel I stayed in dated decor broken aircon on arrival no coffee tea making facilities no bottle of water in the room Breakfast EUR25 is a rip off in a soul less cold lobby The only redeeming feature is the top floor bar It is undergoing refurbishment so there is hope  The only redeeming feature is the top floor bar ,0
No Negative Staff was friendly and helpful Train was close and only a 8 minute ride into the center ,1
 The club room I was upgraded to was tiny adequately equipped but tiny Entrance is impresssively wooden,0
 There is no ventilation in the toilets and bathroom nothing at all There was noise from the street because of renovations and nobody warned us when we were given the quiet room which we had asked for Some members of the staff were unfriendly  The location is perfect ,0
 Breakfast was slightly pricey Excellent location facilities and bed and beautifully clean ,1
 For 16 each you d expect them to use quality produce The scrambled eggs were terrible probably not using fresh eggs and the sausages more filler than meat Even though breakfast was included reception tried to charge us again on leaving and it took an age to sort out Receptionist very unfriendly Woken up by constant ringing at the door by Chambermaid Rather than giving up or opening the door to see if the room was occupied Had to get up to stop her ringing the bell Not happy  Location about the only thing going for it,0

 We wanted to change our reservation we even wanted to extent our booking But when we come to the hotel the host and hostess told us they cannot change the booking they can just give us a new room and we had to pay for all rooms It was incredibly stupid They didn t even try to understand and solve the problem It was a nightmare I cannot suggest anyone to stay at this money oriented hotel No Positive,0
 I would like a refund please The only decent aspect was that the staff were pleasant but they did nothing to control evict the shouty sweaty yobs in the bar in their hi viz outfits and dirty work boots A great Saturday night  Staff nice That s all Avoided breakfast despite having paid Booked luxury double given small shabby twin Offered family room instead but bed was too small for two normal sized adults Bathroom door had bashed in panel grimy seal around shower door I have photos 3 Loud foul mouthed workmen drinking in the bar restaurant ruined the evening All very low grade and not what we d paid for re room booked Over 116 ,0
 None Very friendly helpful and professional staff Comfortable and clean room Excellent location Reasonable value for money,1
 Poor customer service in bar and at breakfast Housekeeping tried to access room at 8 50 am to clean despite us not having checked out Great location and choice of rooms offered,0
 Of course the room was very tiny I couldn t afford a larger one That makes it difficult to stay for an extended period of time  Great breakfasts Location was fantastic for me ,1
 Everything was good Very delicious breakfast we had a room on the sixth floor and a big balcony with a beautiful view on the Pirelli Tower The hotel is in a very convenient location 5 minutes from the railway station and 20 minutes from the city center We will definitely choose this hotel again when staying in Milan ,1
 Staff service in bars was very very slow Accommodation is overpriced given location Paying to park at location is not suitable  View was great Room was nice,0
 I like Mercure Hotels design and especially fuchsia colour in the logo and design after latest renovations some of the hotels are getting more darker For compact hotels this design makes them look smaller  Central location good hotel ,1
 Bed was old and made us roll to the middle Great location,1
 No amenities in the bathroom how nice it is to wash your hair with a plain soap sheets with stains on the top fortunately the inside seemed clean very small hanging rail and closet  Calm and modern Nice lobby Nice bathroom No noise Nice pillows Nice location nearby the Opera House ,0
"If you could, run away from this horrible place. I don't think this hotel deserves any star! The room is unbelievably small. Carpet is dirty. The bathroom door can not close. The bath tub is not clean. The TV is small and is still in CRT age. All in all, it is a miracle that this hotel can survive so long.",0
 Food drink and all other things expensive when at hotel Spa flat rate of 10 even if only going in for a quick swim Normally 15 as well to guests  Close proximity to good transport links in to centre ,1
 Awful location only option to get there and feel safe at night is by taxi Rooms are loud can hear all big industrial vehicles going past bed rolled around the room like a toy pram Not cheap  Nice varied facilities Unfortunately you have to pay for things like use of baggage scale Staff were great about leaving boxes in advance Free shuttle is primary reason for staying ,0

 The water pressure in the shower is extreme  Nice breakfast buffet staff is very helpful ,1
 Unfortunately the Apollo was going thru renovations so the place looked like a bomb had gone off We didn t get a nice relaxed vibe and felt under tension during out stay One afternoon after walking around Amsterdam for 6 hours or so we returned to our room and it hadn t been cleaned As we had to have a shower with dirty towels and as we were on a timeline for the next function we were disappointed  Beds were comfy The room was clean upon arrival but not cleaned in time the following day Shower was good but the design resulted in a lot of water spray over the floor which resulted in really wet towels,0
 The layout of the facilities in the bathroom wasn t well planned The shower leaked because the curtain fixing wasn t positioned well Staff at the reception desk didn t appear very well clued up or attentive as repeated questions asked  Clean room and sufficient for the purpose of an overnight stay in the city Easy to get to work the following morning ,0
 Decided against eating there after manager in bar made an incredible seen about why he didn t put salt on frozen margarita rim completely unnecessary and rude even lectured staff within earshot for 20 mins after Very uncomfortable when my husband had only asked for a salt shaker and did not complain at all had one predinner drink and left No Positive,0
"Stayed at the Hyatt for - nights for a business trip. Got a good corporate rate, but you have to pay for parking (garage underneath the hotel) and internet access (I didn't use it). Some reviews complained about the elevators, but I had no delays - they do have a glass back wall to see the hotel interior. The hotel was recently renovated, and everything was nice & clean. The bed was good, with plenty of extra pillows. The bathroom was large with lots of counter space.
The workout room was good, although the pool is NOT ---hours. I just missed it at -- p.m. closing time. The downstairs bar, store, restaurants, etc. were convenient. The location was good for my purposes - not far from the circle.
I can't think of anything special about the place, but also nothing to really complain about.",1

"My daughter and I were on a college visit and were looking for a comfortable, nice place to stay that was centrally located to the Freeway. SDSU had recommended this hotel and we were really suprised at how nice it was. The landscaping was beautiful and although it is billed as a convention center, it was a lovely resort with a nice pool. The room had been recently renovated and we had a wonderful view. It was close to public transportation and within walking distance to a large mall and movie theater. It was a great value for the money. There were really nice restaurants on the property as well. The hotel employees were extremely helpful and friendly.",1
 The room was cozy the shower was broken not fixed after we notified staff Wi fi was limited although during booking it said there would be wi fi  Room was clean tidy the hotel is located very close to the underground ,0
 The room temperature is regulated centrally means when I arrived it was ice cold I spoke to the reception and they were first reluctant to change the temperature since this was affecting all other rooms on the floor as well SInce another guest was also freezing they did change it and with the heating on it got acceptable The coffee machine in the room was old and rusty wouldnt want to put water in the container I was on the thrid floor and in the room was a constant sound from the air conditioning Even though it was turned off My friend slept on the 1st floor and it was very loud from other guests and the restaurant until late at night Wouldnt return to that hotel  Great location friendly staff Size of the room very spacious ,0
 The family room was very small for a family with teenagers I would recommend this room only if you have younger kids or if it is important that you are all in one room It felt cramped  The staff was knowledgeable friendly and very helpful Good location Beautiful and centrally located ,1
 We didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away  Very quiet location considering so close to Fleet Street comfortable bed ,1

 poor cleaning service very few staffs Location is good,0
 everything is good but the rooms are too small the free WIFI,1
 So disgusting that they didnt change the sheets Should have thought that a 4 star hotel would put on clean sheets especially because we asked for it by hanging the sign on the door please make up the room Even though the hotel wasnt fully booked they gave us a bad room just above the tube so I had trouble sleeping and was woken up early both saturday and sunday Not really what I expected for the Price and a 4 star hotel  Good location ,0
 the smell the narrow room the view to nothing the staff,0
 Very poor room service the phone did not work No toiletries were included such as toothpaste toothbrush bathroom slippers The refrigerator was not switched on even after speaking to the staff Not enough milk provided  The location,0
 The room was tiny and a bit run down It was also in the basement The whole hotel needs a bit of renovation While it was generally clean it wasn t spotless clean which is what you d expect from a 4 stars hotel and the price The bath didn t look clean enough to lie in and there was a white crusty stain on the bed headboard I also had to pay additionally for breakfast In general a disappointment upon arrival as it looks much better on the pictures No Positive,0

Cute Place...clean..location is great..close to nice dining and the beach...one suggestion..stay on the third floor....we were on the second floor and the guests above us were really loud...so loud we did not sleep. We had to complain three times. Did not seem like the manager on duty did much. The noise continued all night. Otherwise okay place to stay. Probably will not stay again.,0
 Not easy to find My original room booked got changed A lot of noise from upstairs room floorboards and very thin partition as I could hear other guests The shower door was jammed I also found unnecessary items in the room like spare light bulbs and tools like screw driver and other bits The breakfast area was cramped and I didn t really enjoy my breakfast either  I liked the hotel and its features and staff The whole place was very warm and welcoming ,0
 Nothing at all  Pretty much everything but a nice sized room with lovely tech touches ,1
"I know this is an older hotel, but they have done a wonderful renovation job. The beds are soooooooooo comfortable, the bathrooms are new(ish), they have new HD TV's and our closet had a small refrigerator. The staff was very nice. The fitness center seemed nice and they offer coffee, tea, lemonade and hot chocolate ---- in a very nice lobby area. This is not the place for you if: you need closet space for clothes, a relaxing spa at the end of the day, a good breakfast ,mind sitting at a desk with the air conditioner blowing on you or a comfortable bath tub. Breakfast eggs were disgusting, but there are a variety of pastries and fruit, and it is crowded at breakfast.",0
No Negative Breakfast location,1
 The first room they gave us had a small double bed which had wall against it top bottom and side only suitable for 1 person you would have to climb over each other to get out We were moved to a better room The air conditioning kept turning off automatically it was the hottest night of the year We had friends staying in another room and they had the same problem with the air conditioning location was good,0
 Too dark Position,0

 The lift was very small which would make it difficult for larger pieces of luggage A lack of standard tea bags in the room so we bought our own Cups for tea coffee in the room were small and disposable it would have been preferable to have proper cups rather than thin throw away ones as this was not very environmentally friendly  Very clean and comfortable room Staff friendly and helpful A convenient location a brisk 15 to 20 minute walk to the Louvre Conveniently located for both the metro and local shops and restaurants I would definitely stay here again ,1

 Staffs are not friendly Clean breakfast,0
"Very pretty little motel, and $--- for a room with a full kitchen isn't a bad deal in SF. However, the two most important things for us are a good mattress and decent water pressure. Mattress seemed both very firm, and lumpy--neither of us slept well all night. (We do a lot of hotel travel, and have rarely slept so poorly due to the mattress being uncomfortable.) And the shower pressure was extremely weak--hand-held shower, with not enough pressure to actually spray, just sort of dribbled.
Apart from these issues, it's a great-looking place, with nice folks at the front desk, and we had no problems with street noise (our room was at the back of the property, so ask for that if street noise is an issue for you). We'd have liked to return, but that bed was a deal-killer.",0
 Had to wait to check in Poor cleaning of light in room Difficult key system Difficult to switch of all light get complete darkness Noisy at night  Awesome location Friendly staff nice resto bar ,1

 This is definitely not a 5 star product There are too many compromises on quality Our carpet was torn and frayed there were only two pillows on a double bed only 4 coat hangers the bathroom has soap dispensers and no amenities the standard of a business travellers hotel but so wrong in a luxury hotel curtains and artwork were cheap and tasteless They promise two restaurants but in practice all meals including breakfast are served next door in a Thai restaurant And the vehicle access is like a service alley Do not expect this to excite It s just a disappointment and deluded to be described as 5 star  Rooms are oversized for a city hotel,0

 Went down to the pool to relax However since it is a small area and lots of kids it was very loud and frustrating I understand this is out of your hands so maybe implementing a kids hour or two would make the pool area a little more peaceful  The view in our room was the best I ve ever had Big Ben and the view of the bridge were amazing ,1
 Very expensive Everything was great loved the big shower and comfortable bed,1
 The view from our room wasn t great but we didn t really care We came for a comfortable clean hotel room and that is what we got The outside of the building lacks charm but again the rooms restaurant and customer service make up for that  The location of the hotel near Kensington Garden was great We could easily walk to 3 different tube stations Notting Hill Gate Bayswater and Queensgate This offered a lot of opportunity to get around London via the tube The staff was extremely friendly and helpful I was able to get ice from the restaurant which also offered great dining options The breakfast buffet was also amazing ,1

 Our flight leaving Amsterdam for Dubai did not leave till 8 00pm So we checked out as per the required time earlier in the last day We sat around for almost 5 hours waiting for our car to take us to the airport For people leaving the city a late checkout would be appreciated  The concierge was really helpful Made our stay very comfortable He knew what the recommended ways of travel and explained the ticket procedures for trams and trains for all the sites we tried to see We had earlier been advised to not use taxis because of their gross charges This was our first time in Amsterdam and Holland The restaurant on the first floor was also very good Excellent meals and service ,1

I just returned from staying at the Wellington with extended family and I thought it was great. It is an older property but the staff were very helpful. I was upgraded to a suite which gave us plenty of room. The decor could be updated however it was clean. The heat didn't work great but we were warm enough. I am hoping to stay at the Wellington again this summer (if the price is right) with other family members.,0
No Negative Room was clean well equipped and spacious with very comfortable beds The staff were helpful and polite After a very busy day walking round a trade exhibition the foot massagers in the lobby were a godsend This hotel is perfectly placed for functions and exhibitions at excel ,1
"I have stayed in hotels throughout Europe, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Asia and have never had less value for money than that at the Kings Inn. Grubby reception, badly decorated rooms, a bathroom in which the wash basin was stained, no coffee making facility (not even polystyrene cups for the bathroom), plumbing noises every ten or so minutes throughout the night and a fumble in the dark for the light switch on the table lamp. The front desk receptionist was businesslike but consequent reception persons were rather more surly. Despite the clean appearance of the bedding, I left the hotel after two nights covered in what I have since been informed were bed bug bites. Not a pleasant stay, and one would expect rather more from a hotel in a prime location close to popular attractions",0

No Negative Fantastic hotel staff were great Spa facilities were lovely Fantastic night on the roof top bar ,1
"Second time I have stayed here as my accommodation is normally dictated by the conference I am in DC attending. The Marriott is well placed for the sights and next to a major Metro intersection and a Macy's, with a Starbucks in the lobby, and a Cosi next door.
Comfy bed, nice sized room and efficient service. The airline check-in terminals in the lobby were useful too.
I did miss having a room safe, but these seem surprisingly absent in DC hotel rooms. The Concierge also misdirected me to the Post Office on Penn and --th, which is not a fully functioning Post Office but just sells stamps - they should know these things. Minor complaint though.",1
 There was only one type of scotch at the bar according to the menu and they seems to be out  I liked almost everything about this hotel but what really made it was the little things like seeing my name on the TV when I walked in the room And the moo pad That was cool ,1

 Lobby bar staff were not so pleasant Unpleasant having all the street vendors accosted you walking down the street  Staff at reception were extremely helpful printed off schedules booked train for us helpful hints for restaurants ,0
 The only small criticisms are 1 The breakfast buffet should be more expansive and include more items of food i e more types of fruit in the continental breakfast This is especially in consideration of the price they charge per head 2 Room service menu is very limited in the day time As a 5 star Leading Hotel it should not be limited to cold food only in the day time and hot food should be available 24 hours a day but wasn t It was limited to sandwiches and salads in the day time  The staff were fantastic and overall the experience was very good A particular thanks to Sara Concierge who made the trip all that more special based on her recommendations of where to dine Location is fantastic for shopping and within walking distance to everything ,1

"This property is outstanding! One of the best ICH Hotels I have ever stayed at due to the professionalism, knowledge, and hospitality of every single associate I encountered in my stay. This group of people really have an understanding of their guests and know how to make them feel that they are mindful of their every need. The level of service does not usually find its way into a ICH Hotel (although they do deliver a good and acceptable product in their chain). The best! I would recommend this property to anyone that is visiting Austin or within reach - it's worth the trip!",1

 We booked the romantic superior room based on the fact the pictures on booking com suggest that prosecco macaroons will be in the room on arrival Please be aware that you have to pre reserve this and pay an additional cost above the value of the room and so we felt the advertising on booking com was a little misleading  Nice cosy hotel in a good location only a 10min walk to Arc de Triomphe and close to a number of metro RER Bus stops for easy access to other major attractions Eiffel Tower 20 mins away for example Bed is very very comfortable all the staff were helpful and friendly and on hand for any questions we had ,1

 Good news: the room was clean, the bed decent, and best of all I was -- stories up from the maddening crowd! Bad news:Elevators need to be upgraded. Bed linens smelled like burned-bleach napkins at some family restaurant where the owners still use ones they bought -- years ago.

The furniture they picked is trendy but also comfy, even the pull out bed was comfortable and inviting. I've never stayed anywhere where everything was great, the room, the pool, the decor, and their amazing restaurant, lowkey but with the best fish tacos and guacamole ever. I think that the best thing about this place is whether your an out-of-towner, or a phoenician looking for a mini-vaca, this is the place.",1

"Our $----nt room was - way too small, a bit run down, and not much to look at decor wise. But it did seem to be clean and the bed was nice and soft. Still, it wouldn't be on my list to visit again. Sorry Marriott, I usually really like your properties, but this one just falls short. Perhaps an update to the lobby- bar area and cleaner looking hallways could help. It just seemed dark and not inviting. Plus the $---nt parking fee is just crazy. The best part is the location, which is not too far from the Hancock and river. Would recommend the JW Marriott in the loop over this in a heartbeat.",0
 Breakfast could have been better Not much choice of food for all meals especially dinner Good location at good price,1
 Staff rude Concierge should not be consulted because they sell you the product expensive instead of showing you where to get it they are not helpfull Also front desk charge you to empty the minibar The intenet is too slow 1 shared electrical outlet only in the room  Location big room nice bathroom big balcony strong shower which is the best I found in all hotels I stayed in ,1
 expensive too modern furniture and room setup clean modern somehow functional,0

 To be honest we loved this accommodation we traveled as a family of 4 mum dad 12 year old son and 18 year old daughter and we had to havre 2 suites which was abit of a shame  Amazing location clean tidy suites nice large bathrooms comfy beds Great breakfast Our son loved the roof top pool Would definately return to this hotel ,1
No Negative the hotel was super comfortable very clean and modern Staff were very friendly as well the location is not at the city center however the metro stop is only 100 meters away so was well connected will definitely stay there again ,1
 Mattress was a bit rubbish so didn t have the best night s sleep Parking is also difficult to find when a van is parked across the concealed entrance and 15 night is a touch expensive  A nice clean hotel with two very reasonable restaurants attached Room was fine other than the old mattress 12pm checkout definitely a bonus though ,1
 Staff ignored arrival no help with bags standard double room booked received a twin room and no offer of fixing the request Will never book here again and have travelers in London monthly No Positive,0

 I did not realise that i need to book time for spa in advance otherwise no chance to get in especially around 14 of February as the spa is open to all including non hotel guests  I liked the idea that it has spa so I booked the hotel for our 10 anniversary,0
 17 for a breakfast is a rip off especially with waiters who are very slow to provide coffee etc Quality room,0
 Central location means traffic and noises from the road are heavy even at night Also beware of city tax fee at the end of stay which is not written or contracted anywhere  Brilliant location lovely room and helpful staff for the most part Location meant it was easy to get to practically anywhere in Paris using the metro or walking ,1
 Gym was closed due to being refurbed that s the only downside to my stay at the HILTON I liked the location staff cleanliness and food,1
 For the amount of money you paid you dont get the treatment you deserved The staff at the reception was rather stuck up and they dont smile Maybe is a spanish culture 15th floor lounge food is not constantly refreshed  Nice location near the beach and shopping centre Is fairly a new area and is very well kept ,0
No Negative The hotel is located just a short walk from Schwedenplatz a local transport hub the staff are great and breakfast superb I booked a single room and the bed was rather narrow 90 cm compared to single rooms in other hotels but still an excellent hotel ,1
 cons the rooms are old and in need of refurbishment for the price we paid it is definitely not worth it the toilet is terrible too with no draining system on the floor leaving the floor wet all the time after showering which could have been prevented if there is a proper draining system not to mention the shower head could not be place properly and have to hold it all the time during shower these are basics amenities that should not be overlook  pros near shepherd bush station and westfield shopping mall lovely neighbourhood surrounding the hotel ,0
"first time in San Francisco-last time at Hilton on O'Farrel Street-rooms are very small, didn't even have room to fit suitcases. Parking garage is another horrible story and is very expensive to park. The only thing nice about the hotel was the lobby.",0

 A little expensive for what you received and in comparison with some three four star hotels in the same area Notwithstanding the has a lot to contribute but asking to pay for wifi is retrograde and demeaning it is free just about everywhere  Staff were very helpful ,0
 The room The lobby,0
 The room was very small No place to put your luggage properly For a longer stay it lacks the comfort of relaxing in a lounge area which is hardly existent  Quiet room very service oriented staff perfectly located in quiet street at walking distance from Mus e d Orsay and the Louvre Small but beautiful and very efficiently decorated bathroom ,1

 I have been in better Novotel s Sauna is small no place to cool down and relax and no changing facilities the room was ok but the douche was leaking and you re becoming intoxicated by the air fresheners  the breakfast was fair ,0
 The small Spa was good but over priced for customers staying The bar was too noisy and not welcoming coming back to at night The open plan library is also inappropriately situated next to the bar Personally I would prefer a hard copy of hotel directory in the room not on line There was a fausty smell damp in our room which I should have mentioned to the staff  Beds were very comfortable The soaps etc were good The staff also helpful The spa was fine but could be larger and available to paying guests Treatments could then be charged ,0
 Room was small I have booked 3 single beds but when came to the room it was 2 single beds and fold up bed I have paid more for the room to have 3single beds specially but it was disappointing to see stay in the room for 200euros Also room was not clean carpet was sooo dirty walls had marks on them Room looked very tired and we had to pay extra for breakfast  Breakfast and staff was nice,0

"I feel this hotel needs to be investigated for very unsanitary conditions, not to mention unprofessional management staff. This hotel is a horrible reflection of Detroit!

 Nothing Everything,1
 The part built structure next door which hasn t changed since last year It is an eyesore The service in the downstairs bar is a little slow as the staff have to serve a variety of areas both inside and outside  The proximity to the Forum for Primavera Sound The easy walk to the beach The outside seating areas on both the ground and 15th floors The staff as whole were very attentive and helpful especially the concierge who looks after the luggage The rooms are large enough not huge and well kitted out ,1
 Nothing Friendly staff great location,1
 we found the price quite expensive but as we were limited to what dates we could travel we were limited to look elsewhere  the staff were friendly in particular upon arrival and being given a choice of rooms with a follow up call in the room to ask if we were happy,1
 Thermostat needs turned up ran a bath after a long day in London and it was dissapointing requested a southern view but didn t receive even after check in staff told me I did have breakfast was lukewarm so once it hit the plates it became cold quickly was asked for 60 deposit for mini bar and when checking out they managed to charge me again instead of refunding very dissapointing for my first hilton visit  It was clean ,0
 Thought the hotel was a bit nearer the 02 but they did have a courtesy bus to take us to the nearest tube which was good So clean and quiet with a lovely breakfast,1

 The picture in site ita deffirent than hotel I booked suprerier room they gife me standard toom The bathroom not clean  ,0
 The rooms are very small The bed is not comfortable at all the matrice is too soft and it is a very small bed I would expect from a 4 stars hotel to have at least a bed that is a regular double size bed All in all it is not good value for money as it is quite expensive and the only things that are good about it are the location and the truly helpful staff Other than that i would rate it as a less than 3 stars hotel very helpful and kind staff location is very good in a nice neighbourhood close to underground stations,0
No Negative Staff are helpful Location is excellent Value is acceptable,1
 In flexibility of staff Very inflexible and would never stay with chain again,0
 I thought the use of spa would have been included instead we had to pay 10 per time plus 7 50 for the sandals The turkish room was out of bounds too You also had to pay extra 8 for room service  Comfy beds Pleasent staff nice food even if a little pricey 15 50 for a club sandwich It was delish mind As it was my partners birthday the staff filled the bed with balloons which was a lovely and personal touch ,1
No Negative Everything,1
"Some friends and I went to The Jimmy, the rooftop bar at The James Hotel, for drinks at sunset. What an amazing view! The drinks were pricey but delicious and we figured we were paying for the ambiance. Try the cucumber vodka, it is a special treat. The outside area has a small pool, and I had to wonder how many drunk people had fallen into it over the years. The place is small and it got pretty packed, but it was a nice spot for a couple of drinks. Don't expect to hang out there all night unless you want to drop a lot of dough.",1

 Having stayed in many nice hotels this misses the mark for being a supposed 5 hotel My room was small the bed was cheap and springy the sheets didn t even reach the end of the bed I had a view of a brick wall and roof This felt more like an Ibis and I was left disappointed It s a good location but if it s luxury you are after this is not it  Excellent location in the heart of the city ,0
No Negative Clean friendly,1
 After 3pm we checked in went to the room Room key worked but the room was occupied by somebody else Took us one hour to get another room The location is great ample parking and an area without much city noise,1

 room was very small no shower curtain no cold water in showerNo Positive,0
 Not a bad experience per se but it was evident that reception team needed training on customer service smiling and friendly nature doesn t cost restaurant team were lovely didn t like that when we ordered room service on each night that adding gratuities was to be added unless I specifically said no If I m ordering food and feel from start to finish service was fab then ill pay a tip but not at the point of ordering I was made to feel bad that I didn t want to tip I do frequently just didn t feel like anything wowed me  Room size Brenda I think from Breakfast each morning was fabulous she remembered us and took great care of us ,0
 The sink in our room was blocked and even after reporting it its was not fixed  Very modern hotel nice area Close to tube station and easy to find ,0
 I didn t appreciate to be 29 for an early checking 11 AM instead of 2 PM especially as the bed wasn t even open and I had to open it myself Switch for bathroom was impossible to find see photos bed isn t comfortable cleanliness is really not up to Austrian standards and windows can t be open  Excellent location right on the ring 10 20 mm from most city center s attraction and right across the street from Urania movie theater and excellent restaurant a preferred alternative for breakfast if you are a late riser Staff was helpful especially the charming lady attending breakfast 14 euros is overrated though ,0
 Tiny room and when ordered room service they charged a delivery charge of 5 to bring it up the lift I thought that was disgusting as room service is expensive enough without charging an extortionate amount to bring it to your room  beautiful view of tower bridge,1

 Many of the staff seemed inexperienced and we encountered an unusual number of misunderstandings The wifi was very weak in the room and when we attempted to use the business lounge it was closed at 10am Apparently it needed some repair  We absolutely loved the location We used the underground with ease and enjoyedl the many amenities along Gloucester Road The cleanliness of the hotel was 5 5 and the buffet breakfast was always a good start to the day ,1
 Heated pool would have been nice  A beautifully designed and appointed hotel in the middle of the Gothic quarter great access to the harbor and center or Barcelona Rooftop terrace with pool is a great way to watch the sunset ,1
 The access card to my room didn t work at all I used it 3 times during my staying and each time I had to go down to reception to reactivate it Super annoying No robe  The room was super quiet and because I was on the 4th floor I enjoyed the natural light coming in ,1

 Although the room is full with good facilities but is very small and makes it hard to move especially if you are staying as two with a child Also there are a lot of great facilities but missing basic stuff like a kettle and cups to make some tea or coffee  The hotel is new modern clean and price is convenient Great location next to Tower of London and above a train station which makes it easily accessible Next to the hotel there is a great parking space which is only 2 pounds to leave it from 7pm till 6am and also on weekends in general the price to keep the whole day is only 28 during week days Huge bed one of the biggest great for couples ,1
 We had breakfast over two mornings On both days when we left the table to get our cooked breakfast staff cleared away our juice and cutlery without checking that we were still in the dining room This was quite annoying The bar area and dining room were very good First room was noisy so they changed us to another room which was much better,1

"I enjoyed a - night stay here with my husband and one year old. Impressive reception area lead to high expectations...unfortunately we found the room quite cramped by the time we got the travel cot in. Also, room service and breakfast in the Famous Oakroom was overly expensive. On the upside, we really liked the traditional style and feel to the place. It felt like the couples and families we met here had been coming back for years. In terms of location, it was perfect for us- close enough to nice shops and restaurants on Newbury street and great shopping in Copley Place and the Prudential centre.",0
 We had the following issues within 3 nights Fire alarm 2x due to a system error One of them happened at 8am for 5min in the morning on Saturday On the same day the room was not serviced cleaned even though we explicitly had the sign outside the door to clean the room On Monday the shower as well as the sink had just hot boiling water which made it impossible to take a shower Therefore our departure was delayed The hotel was not cooperative to refund parts of our stay  We could leave our luggage at the reception and get our flight tickets printed ,0

 There was only the one lounge chair for relaxing when it was a twin bedroom It was also a very stark room like a chair and or a painting was missing The lock on the door was missing its cover so it looked broken but it still worked The sink plug was very difficult to get up and down Needed the assistance of the staff and they had trouble  The concierge was extremely helpful The beds were very comfortable and it was quiet The location was very good The free wifi was very welcome ,1

"This hotel is built """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""into"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the parking garage for the Convention Center. The location is convenient, but we heard noise, either from the Convention Center, or from lower floors of the hotel, all night. 
The rooms are clean and well furnished and the buffet breakfast at the hotel restuarant was fine. The front desk staff were polite and attentive but blamed the noise on the Convention Center.
Although the hotel shows parking overnight (in the Convention Center parking garage adjoining the hotel) for $-- (with free ins and outs) on the Hilton website, we were told this does not apply to weekends when the Convention Center has shows. Therefore we had to pay over $-- for one in and out and spaces were hard to find in the garage.",0
 When we came in from the theater no food available apart from room service thought this was very poor and so did several others We also tried to book a meal for 27 guests on Saturday lunch nobody even returned calls  Everywhere clean afternoon tea lovely staff very friendly Booked 2 rooms one had sloping ceiling which was not good for someone 6 6 tall Both rooms were supposed to be upgrades Doubtful ,1

No Negative One of the best hotels I ever stayed in The attention to detail in the rooms and living area is amazing The restaurant is beautiful tranquil and the food is out of this world I enjoyed eating at the hotel much more than eating in town Staff is relaxed and friendly yet extremely efficient It is a real retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city ,1
 Nothing everything was great  The hotel is great and in a great location Definitely staying in there next time I will be in London ,1
 Breakfast too expensive and our children 13 and 15 had to pay the full price No coffee machine in the room Kettle yes but no teabags No Positive,1
 Breakfast Quite a confusing way of separating the breakfast and the cost for each segment It could have been much better for the guests as well as the Hotel personnel if a buffet type is available with all products and a single cost as in most hotels Reception the old traditional reception style is making us feel more comfortable when it comes to a hotel  The location was great as well as the hotel facilities Room space for the room we had was good but please note this was not the standard room which we knew that it is relatively small ,0

 One bathroom for 5 of us Only a curtain sheer between the 2 rooms so really one big room only and terrible view Thank God for great staff who make this place worthwhile Location is a 10 10 Even a supermarket nearby to get some snacks for the kids Loads of pastry shops and restaurants at your doorstep to the hotel The staff were very accomodating Facilities were basic but location awsome Could walk to la ramblas barri gottic and plaza Catalunya Staff were so helpful in booking tours if needed The staff really make it worthwhile because the actual hotel needs a little revamping ,1
 The selection of drinks at the pool terrace bar were very limited and when asking for a cocktail they had ran out of most spirits so only had wine  The roof terrace is lovely big comfy beds and the staff are very helpful ,1

"If you are looking for a small quiet centrally located hotel with good prices, this is the place for you. We found the service to be outstanding- the staff was incredibly helpful having a car arranged for us at Newark and also with getting my wife's birthday cake up in her room on our arrival. Then they were nice enough to keep putting it in and taking it out of the fridge for us! When you include all the free perks (breakfast, internet, gym) that a lot of other high price hotels don't include, this place is even more of a gem. The rooms aren't huge, but when we're in NYC, we don't spend a lot of time in our rooms anyhow! Rick's cafe makes for a great area to chill and relax when you do have a few extra minutes",1
 Room was dated and in need of attention Poor dated hairdryer stuck on wall and lack of movement why Move with the times even gym has better facilities in changing rooms Breakfast was horrible seating far too big for tables and made movement for self service difficult Breakfast was YUK again cheap produce cooked badly now I know why the Europeans hate our food Come on we have great quality food in the UK use it  Location good for us,0

"We stayed four nights at the Rex in july. The room was neat clean and comfortable although a little on the small side. Location wise its a good place to stay with close public transport and a short walk to china town. There were a lot of street people in SF who looked rather nasty. Fortunately the rex was in an area they didn't seem to frequent . I certainly would not like to be staying down the lower end of town it looked bad.
We would stay at the rex again and recommend it.",1

"We booked this hotel primarily because of location - ideally situated to Capitol Hill and Union Station AND roof-top pool for the kids to cool off this past summer. The pool was great apart from the fact there was some big fraternity gathering in the city whith purple shirts everywhere - and basically overtook the pool on the second day, but that was not the hotel's fault.
Rooms are well designed. Staff friendly, apart from the cafe staff who were, I believe, used to hob-nobbing with Capitol Hill business people so not great if you're """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""just a tourist""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""!!
We booked with Expedia and again had a less than desireable room so negotiated a change of room and ended up paying out more.",0
 The location might not be ideal if you re in London for tourism or want to be in Central London But the hotel is accessable through public transport and it takes about 45 minutes to Central London  Spacey and luxuorios room for a reasonable price in London Very comfortable bed and you have everything you need The staff were all very service minded and helpful Nice pub on the ground floor of the hotel ,1

 Room was a bit small It was a basement room so awkward to get to and very poor phone signal The bathroom had a drain smell so I needed to keep the door shut and that cured the smell problem but meant that the bathroom was very cold Staff were very friendly and helpful Good warm room High standard of decoration Very clean,1
 Double bed was rather small and shower controls difficult to get the right temperature Loud noise from shower disturbing to our neighbours  Nice quiet room good breakfast and reasonably priced set menu for evening meal Excellent location close for London sightseeing ,1

 The look of the dining breakfast area Went elsewhere  The room very comfy xo,1
 Even though hotel parking was advertised the parking was a solid 15 minutes walk away a total palaver to park and to get out of the the car park and the car park had nothing to do with the hotel just discounted rates I had told the hotel I was going to be checking in late then I get a call from the night staff asking for my credit card details I was told the booking was not confirmed and had to pay over the phone to keep the room  Staff Very helpful and apologetic for the number of misunderstandings and misleading information created by booking com and hotel owners ,0
 The breakfast staff except Diana was disorganized  The location was excellent ,1
 The hotel is weary and in great need of refurbishment It is only value for money because of its location not for its rooms or facilities  Location is excellent HAKAN works tirelessly in this establishment He is an EXTREMELY VALUABLE EMPLOYEE without whom this hotel just would not be able to operate,0
 The restaurant within the hotel was terrible my meal burger and fries was raw in the middle sent back then came up worse than the first time I could have got food poisoning or worse asked for the manager but he had gone home it was only 6 30pm Run by Muppets the cook is a health hazard  Close to Nou camp Very clean large Appartment Very nice ,1

 not changing the hotel 9 mths after we had paid for it it is quite obvious that you sold our reservation to the highest bidder sorry I am very displeased the way you behaved the fact that you changed our hotel to mercer st one day before we were scheduled to arrive despite the fact that we had already paid for the room 9 month s earlier and this cost us 18 for a taxi to the royal Albert Hall whereas with previously booked radisson we would have been able to walk so not very pleased with the radisson blu company at all and will not be using you again Brgds MR Richard Rawlinson,0
 Clearer instructions for the bedroom air conditioning heating needed Difficult to know whether adjustments in temperature would work fortunately they did  Warm friendly greeting on Reception positive and helpful Very comfortable bed and larger than normal bedroom bathroom facilities well thought out Spacious shower Neat well designed kitchenette with high quality fittings Very clean and comfortable Highly recommended Great value for money and only 20 mins by Tube from Central London ,1
"It is a nice hotel, bang in the center of things. We had a city-view room - with higher buildings all around this translates to a no-view room :(
The front desk staff need some serious training - they are too brusque and dismissive of small requests and-or complaints. This is not a big deal though.
But we had spacious clean room. Everything was a short walk away.",0

"Visited New York for the first time in June-July ---- and enjoyed our stay at the Waldorf so much that we booked at the Waldorf for December -----January ---- in July. Requested Park Ave view again. Arriving at the hotel, we found the entire Park ave side had scaffolding and shade cloth. The construction sounded like a hammer drill all day long. None of this was communicated to me prior to our arrival! We again had two rooms, one for my -- and -- year old sons and one for my wife and myself, so double the heart ache due to the Waldorf Astoria spoiling our vocation, Christmas and New Year break!",1
"As Bette Davis would say, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What a dump!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Four Seasons hotel chain needs to either remove its name from this location or put some good money into renovations.
Skip this hotel and stay elsewhere.

"Was a little worried about choosing this place because of reviews but was pleasantly surprised. I did not feel unsafe at anytime even walking to and from the subway. If you are a typical suburbia american you might feel a little out of your element but get over it. It is a big city after all, I did see a little graffiti. I have an -- and -- year old girl and we were fine walking around the area. The accomodations were fine and the breakfast was good.",0

 Room was a little smaller than expected for price paid and reviews read  Location Gloucester road underground was almost opposite This tube is an interchange with several lines passing through Stores such as boots a small tesco and waitrose were nearby Various eateries within 5 mins away too including Paul a money changer across the street for those who really needs it Staff were efficient and helpful esp the Cambodian or myanmese lady we met who studied in singapore ,1
 Nothing is good Staff attitude One person at the reception No one receives call from Housekeeping Cleanliness is pathetic Room cleaning staff dont even clear the waste basket properly Bed is extremely bad the mattress are old and have a dip in center  Other then one can say location there is nothing good Although the web site says 10 minutes walk to underground infect its more One needs to take bus to reach station,0
 It was a bit expensive for me  The luxury room and view,1
 Poor service in restaurant Size of room,0
 The check in was very upsetting The woman who checked me in was very rude and tried to overcharge me for the room While the overcharging could be explained by a misunderstanding I felt her attitude to a client checking in was disgraceful I complained about this on checking out and the other staff were very embarrassed and apologised on behalf of the hotel  Comfortable bed Very clean I forgot a couple of things when I checked out but housekeeping were very helpful in finding these and making them ready for pick up ,1
 No shuttle setvice to metro as it was mentioned while booking tht thr is a free shuttle service to metro  Staff was very friendly,1
 when arrive the initial room had a weird smell then the second room was not properly clean the carpet was worn off the toiletry weren t there in addition to the noticeable noise that came from outside  Location is excellent just a cross the street from train station,0
 I had a problem with my bill where they overcharged my credit card After many many emails back and forth they finally admitted they were wrong and would refund me When I did not see the refund they kept telling me to wait and wait To date there has been no refund only lie after lie Also the key cards don t work you always have to ask the desk to get in your room Mostly it is the lying and the overcharging that was the worst Just avoid this place for the sake of your wallet and to ensure a good trip  The rooms are decent and its an exact corporate style hotel ,0
 not very clean bed uncomfortable very noisy but that can t really be helped with noise from outside  Location bathroom and that there were coffee tea making facilities TV,0

 Was not 100 clean floor in room dirty sink in bathroom cracked which means it holds dirt phone in room broken the room wasn t advertised with a dirty floor and broken phone sink maybe they just upgraded me  It s ok but when I see dirty everything else means nothing,0
 Lights didn t work told the reception and nothing was done  Beds and location Lovely room ,1
 More information about the facilities and entertainments in the hotel will be useful I got a very good price approx 220 GBP a day so it was a good value for money Still sometimes the price is 350 which is not a great deal The operation of the TV could be a pain sometimes the response time is poor  The hotel has a great location in the City wich was very convenient for me not perferct for sightseeing really The room is spotless not a single complain about it The staff is very firendly and reacts immediately on any request The Angler restaurant is really amazing definitely worth visiting ,1

"When in San Francisco we stay at The Hotel Majestic. While perhaps a little tired, this one-hundred and ten year old gem more than makes up for it in charm and decor. The various rooms and public places are furnished with period pieces and prints which lend to an ambiance of a time gone by. While we usually dine at one of the many wonderful restaurants on nearby Fillmore, breakfasts at The Hotel Majestic are quite good. And did I mention affordable? For a quintessential San Francisco experience, look no further.",1
 Very expensive  Clean room and comfortable ,0
 The hotel is absolutely HORRIBLE If you are travelling on your own and like the company of the Norfolk Howard or a few alongside with mice in the dining area this is the place for you Tried to speak to the staff and the hotel manager who just laughed in my face and said to carry investigation on the bed bugs we will have to charge you 350 00 So if you fancy some extreme  There is only one thing to like about this hotel location ,0
 the room was a shoe box with the smallest Tv I have ever seen Very basic room not worth anywhere near the cost of the room Very disappointing breakfast was nice the pool was nice and warm,0
 No hot water in the morning really ruined my day While noisy heating during the night did not good to soothe the tiring nerves No Positive,0

 We ask for double bed and we got single ones we should pay at the reception but they took the money straight from the account and we had to pay a deposit about we don t know about it and for the parking they was charging 15 euro even on the website was saying is free The room was quite big and the bathroom had a bath ,0
 No car park Great welcoming place to stay and great food,1
 Room size was ok but the standard room was dark looking out at the centre building Note if your kids are under 5 they can t use the pool at any time  Great location just off Oxford Road Reasonable sized bath,1
 No car parking The hotel smells badly Rooms are not comfortable Staff we met are not welcoming  Close to la Ramblas,0
 facilities are poor not child friendly poor lift service and no stairs bathroom needs update  location,0
 Some staff were not so friendly Not told about the tourist tax  Good breakfast and showers Tram next to hotel ,0
 you hear the noise from the street location,0
"Well, spent - nights. On night -, awakened at -:-- AM by train whistle repeatedly blowing. Then awakened at -:-- AM by what sounded like someone using my bathroom. Awakened at -:-- AM by people talking on street and a dog barking. On night -, awakened by emergency vehicle siren around --:-- PM. Awakened several times after that by street noise (cars, people, train). The amazing thing was with all these racing through my room, none of them hit my bed. And this is on the --th floor (room ----) and heavy drapes mostly closed but for a small area. On checkout, - staff members basically said, yes, we know, sorry. We need to soundproof the rooms. Thankfully, I had Sunday at home to recover some of my sleep.",0
 See above We are regular visitors the room temp was 29 degrees could not open a window so they gave us a fan took 2days to give it and the bed was a large single shower was either biking hot or cold room number 1130 I have emailed then but have no reply back as yet I just think sad that we experience a baking room small bed and mind of its own shower but we didn t let it dampen our spirits staff was friendly and approachable,0

No Negative Excellent choice if you are travelling with kids and want to stay close to the Oxford regent street and Hyde park Worth every penny ,1
 Worst check in experience and staff attitude I have ever experienced based on approx 1000 lifetime hotel stays  Decent location and general condition,0
 small bed and outmoded furniture lack of renovation good value for a 4 star London hotel although the location about 1 hour from central London and the lack of renovation justify the price,0
 Ripped duvet cover Shower was rubbish no more that a trickle We had to queue for breakfast we were located in the bar on the lower floor as the restaurant was extremely busy we had tiny tables and it was was freezing not happy about this at all  The location We also upgraded to a suite at an additional cost which was nice and spacious for three adults ,0
 A little cold in the restaurant Though in their defence the weather had changed significantly just within the last day I did make this point and immediately it was dealt with But still it felt cool after half an hour Perhaps it could have been where I was sat near the window I asked about the fire in reception It is never lit Apparently I was told the remote control had broken I stayed over a year or two back and it wasn t lit then  The staff made you feel welcome ,1
 bigger dining area for breakfast breakfast queus where possible if you are not an early bird this may be partially solved by recommending breakfast in bed for guests  big fluffy bed modern refurbished look excellent service with bag handlers short way to metro Trainstation ,1
 Far from centre bed too soft bathshampoo etc were not avaikable Though paid cash my credit card was debited for EUR 97 and EUR 71 Cost per room was supposed to be US 89 but the hotel refused to take same currency thus I had to pay US 101 The tariff mentioned in US at time of booking is misleading  Quiet location and quiet room,0
 incredible small rooms even for London staff not very friendly or helpful no restaurant bar for lunch dinner room service they only serve breakfast very poor water pressure in the shower not very clean but I ve seen worst Definitely not a 4 star hotel you can get much better value for your money in a lot of 3 star hotels in the city location is pretty good bathrooms are new,0

 No Free Parking No Helper to get your bags The stuff they new and they don t care No restaurant around your area  Location as far from City and it is nice ,0
 No privacy in the bathroom I travelled with a friend and having no doors on the shower room was unusual and unnecessary No drawers or cupboard space nowhere to put clothes but on a couple of hooks and hangers Probably ok for a business person on a one day trip not for a longer five days in our case tourist stay Just awful No complimentary tea or coffee would be nice to have No twin beds staying with a person who is not a partner can be a challenge  Super location central for all we wanted to do Efficient staff Very nice rooftop spot for a drink ,0

 The brasserie of the hotel was below standard I had a burger and it was dry and tasteless The location the hotel is next to the DLR,1
 Despite it being advertised as being sound proof it was not at all and I could hear people coming in and out shouting The exact reason why I wanted a sound proofed room There was only one front staff and they were not there a lot of the time The room was a bit on the small side  It is a nice looking hotel with good amenities ,0
 The fact that other people in my group got a double room with breakfast for 169 I paid 169 for a crappy single room and breakfast was not included  The concierge gentleman was the only plus to the stay He was pleasant helpful ,0
this place is great .my wife and i stayed for july -th fireworks instead of going to the inner harbor to see the fireworks .we stayed at the hotel and saw it all went well . we did the bed and breakfast and it was out of this world . we had a great time rooms were very clean and everything is within walking distance . i plan to say here everytime i travel to the inner harbor . also i slept like a baby thier beds will put youi to sleep,1
 The rooms were quite small I initially booked the larger Executive room and was surprised to find that I had just enough room to walk around the bed but barely space to leave my suitcase When I moved to a normal room for the last night this room may have been slightly less luxurious but possibly even bigger than the executive room  Fantastic staff I had the pleasure of speaking to the doormen as well as the people at the reception a few times and they were continuously friendly and wonderful Compliments for the doormen especially who were too kind and helpful whenever I needed anything Nice location good gym though extra charge but convenient and they have classes nice facilities and clean ,1

 A bit expensive but in Vienna this is no surprise  Clean comfortable rooms Tram that takes you to the center in 15 minutes stops near the hotel The hotel has its own parking lot Highway is near easy to find ,1
 When I arrived the room was very dusty like it hadn t been cleaned for a while The counters table etc weren t wiped down There was a weird residue When I reported it the front desk person was lovely they came in a wiped things down But then I opened the fridge and that was dirty The next day when I arrived to my room it had been cleaned but the cleaning person left in the middle of the job and left behind their cleaning supplies and towel Keep in mind I arrived at 9pm  The staff were great They responded very quickly ,0
 I seriously cannot think of anything  The staff were so accommodating they upgraded us but we didn t have a river view We questioned this and they changed us again The free shuttle service to Canary Wharf was brilliant Used it frequently Breakfast was amazing The staff are so attentive ,1
 Room too close to breakfast room door do could hear people passing  The location and very comfortable bed and external door in room leading to open garden,1
 We were disappointed with service from the bar staff We wanted a coffee before retiring for the evening There were 4 members of staff on duty All of which ignored us Finally a man came over to where we re waiting and made a phone call rather than serve us A girl then asked what we wanted We replied two lattes please She told us the coffee machine was being cleaned and was therefore unable to make us a coffee We felt this was poor customer service  Great location for a gig at the 02,0

 No tea and coffee and not even able to get a drink at the bar at 11 15 most hotels will serve residents Breakfast should be explained it s only 2 options Granola or bread a bit pricey for 15 We stayed in an easy jet room in Victoria which was the same style as Mimi for 40 a night which served the same purpose Location,0

 Nothing I will definitely be back on by next visit to London  The location in front of Hyde Park around the corner from a Central Line Tube station and just a stroll away from the shopping area at Oxford street is perfect All the staff from the doorman to the reception ladies to the personnel at the restaurants and even housekeeping they all make you feel very welcome The food is delicious unfortunately the Thai restaurant was fully booked but no doubt that it is wonderful as was our dinner at the Island Grill You should definitely have an afternoon tea in the Lounge it was an experience to remember The rooms are very comfortable and the shower was very pleasant enough water and pressure and no loss of pressure when other rooms take a shower which normally happens in many hotels ,1

 Cramped breakfast area The hotel is equipped and feels like a tiny 3 star Nothing 4 star about this place Reception staff has not yet learned how to smile Its a service business you re in for pete s sake Staff is also minimal Issue with room that had to be fixed Hardly any water pressure in shower No free water in room No kettle to heat water for coffee or tea Thin and small towels  Nice breakfast and waiter in breakfast area,0
 Wasn t much not to like although we don t know how much a Standard room normally costs compared to a small double but on this occasion we def got VFM  We had booked small double but got upgraded to a Standard room Stayed in an awful lot of hotels over the years including London and the quality and facilities were definitely above average All the extras including flannels and dressing gowns ,1

 definitely not a 4 hotel We had a leak in our hotel room ceiling phoned reception to complain and the receptionist told me she was too busy to deal with my complaint We then discovered the heating wouldn t work and the bathroom was dirty We demanded our money back and only then did we get escorted to another room No discount on price and no apology Quite disgraceful Will not be back  15 mins walk into Westminster Good location but this comes at a price ,0
 The staff were very unhelpful Tried asking where to park and was told that there was only one carpark that cost 20 euros for the whole time This information was not accurate  The room was very clean very spacious and beautiful Very good value for money ,1
 Heating is too strong so we changed rooms so we could open the window Staff is very very friendly Reception staff very helpful and always with a smile Thank you Breakfast staff as well,1
This hotel is in the middle of being refurbished while its location and the surrounding area are blighted by the construction of a light railway down Central Avenue. The decor and the rooms were tired confirming refurb is overdue. Breakfast average although it seems to be a favourite spot for the local police to come in and write up their reports whilst enjoying a freebie,0

"The Hilton Garden Inn Airport in Phoenix was ok, but I stayed here just after staying at the Hilton Tapitio Cliffs and this room was more expensive and not nearly as nice. The room itself was very nice, but the bedding was not of the usual Hilton quality and my room smelled like it had once been a a smoking room. The air conditioning system was also very loud and I ended up turning it off so I could go to sleep.",0
 Breakfast was not up to a 4 star hotel No coffee machine in room as other 4 star hotels supply these days  Location was good staff were very helpful ,1
 Whilst I was delighted to receive an upgrade the room itself was lovely but there was a terrible smell of smoke which came through the ventilation The set up of the hotel the grounds and social spaces are lovely much more relaxing than a number of central London hotels,0
 It is not 5 star only just 4 The Butler promised didn t materialise room service was slow the Chambers Lounge is somewhere between a British Rail lounge and a second rate airport business class facility Paintings chosen for the suite were absolutely appalling and the Lillies chosen to refresh the the room were the type you get from Tesco As I said not even close to 5 stars The staff try hard but unfortunately I don t believe they know what 5 star looks like The whole experience is in another and inferior league Given the price tag this was a highly unsatisfactory choice  The staircase,0
 The price of the bottled water in the hotel The beds were very comfortable never slept so well in my life Also loved the pillows they were so soft and big ,1
 Generally it was a good experience Just one little thing I would like to mention that I did make a connection with the Wesley about exchanging double bed room to a twin bed room and I received their reply said it was okay if I accepted to pay extra 20 pounds then I did reply as I accepted to pay extra 20 pounds for exchanging to a twin bed room However my reservation did not be changed I still was serviced with a big double bed room Actually I am not sure if I was required for the extra 20 pounds Maybe my requirement was not sent to the Wesley precisely  Breakfast service was good nice cooking and staffs in reception were all nice a well Big room on perfect location i think i will stay again in my next London trip ,0

"I stayed at the Chancellor for several nights in mid-December ----. The hotel is definitely nice and it's in a good location, but I don't think it's spectacular in any way. That is to say, nothing really stood out as being above average. The staff was helpful, the Internet connection was slow, the room was clean. I didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant because the menu was decidedly unimpressive. 
I'd stay there again but I'm going to check out some of the many other hotels in the neighborhood before I do.",0

"The location of the TAJ is fantastic and the prices are good for views of the pretty Boston public garden. It doesn't compare though when looking at the Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons (or even some of the smaller new hotels in town). The rooms are definitely showing their age - in our room there was something drawn on the wall (red marker) behind the door that someone had clearly tried to erase but could still be seen. Carpets are faded, furniture is really dinged up (look down at the tables in the restaurants). And although prices are good there are lots of extra charges.. they charge for using the internet for every device (phone, ipad, computer etc.) that is used. And it's not clearly spelled out anywhere in the room. There's no complimentary water like the Four Seasons .. so you use the mini bar etc.",0
 Breakfast was continental not full English Quality was good but maybe a tad monotonous for a longer stay  The air conditioner broke down on the first night and the temperature in the room was very high The hotel was unable to move us as the hotel was fully booked but they brought us a fan as well as an electric cooling device which brought some relief The next day we were given another bigger room with good air conditioning Hotel staff were willing to help us move our stuff and we received an apology and complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience Wow The room has everything it needs from a Nespresso machine a fridge empty though to a safe The bed was comfy and the shower was very spacious ,1

"Had one of the rooms overlooking the lobby-bar. One would think that they wouldn't put a couple with a toddler in this room. Could barely sleep, listening to bag pipers INSIDE the hotel and all the bar noise bouncing off the glass and the marble. After complaining about the noise to the front desk, was told to come back the next day """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""to see what they could do"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but also that the hotel was sold out. Also the pool looks huge on the website but it is actually tiny (about -'x -'), particularly considering how big the hotel is and that this is San Antonio (hot).",0

"This was way below Marriott typical standard. Cracks around toilets etc....the bed was awesome as in all marriotts, but other than that nothing spectacular! Outside bar of river view was nice but location is a little out of the way. For same price we discovered we could have stayed front and center riverwalk in a nicer hotel!",0

My wait for the shuttle at Logan was no more than -- minutes and the return was right on time. The drivers were fine as were the front desk staff. Furthermore, I was able to get into my room at -- am.
On the other hand, I concur with the other reviews regarding the hotel's location. Aside from the JFK T-stop being only a few minutes walk away, the is nothing else nearby. Furthermore the dining options at the hotel are extremely limited. 
Lastly, they charge for in-room wireless internet.",0

 This is never a 4 star hotel The double bed completely filled the room space impossible to walk round 96 night and 15 for breakfast is a rip off They use private hire taxi s at inflated prices when they could easily use black cabs which are constantly driving past their front door  Location is good,0
 Dirty pillows and shower Shower was lacking power was more like a trickle The noise outside was loud and kept hearing the pedestrian crossing beeping in the night Staff didn t communicate very well We paid cash on arrival then they didn t mark we paid so they tried to take payment on check out  Good location to the tube,0

 Dining facilities adequate but expensive and seemed to be little used we breakfasted in the train station Front desk often busy checking guests in out which made it hard to get information  Convenient location if travelling by train Room was comfortable clean and well equipped Great top floor view over plaza Pleasant 20 minute walk to the Montjuic area that includes the Fundacio Joan Miro the Museu National d Art de Catelunia both very worthwhile ,1
 Swimming pool works only in sunny days from 11 17 No options to take morning swim before discovering the city You can not order in advance breakfast in the room even in the late evening Welcoming staff but not very flexible to client s needs  Service and Honeymoon and birthday cake surprise in the room Balcony view Great location ,0

 I was absolutely appalled that after trawling the Internet for a spa getaway for my boyfriend and I we were expected to pay EXTRA to use the facilities upon arrival in our swim wear I am just very glad we went mid week and didn t have to pay the full 30 per person for weekend use I ve never known a hotel to charge guests to use the facilities and not even at a discounted rate I was also incredibly suprised to be whacked with a 50 bill for parking upon departure Apparently this information was included in the booking but should be a whole lot clearer If I d known all of these extra costs were going to be thrown in I would ve booked a travel lodge as the hotel itself was not worth any more money No Positive,0

"This is a modern hotel with plenty of space in the room. It was clean and comfortable. No restaurant and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""----"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" type of food bar downstairs is pretty lame, but is okay in a pinch to grab a yogurt or something. BUT....it's in the epicenter which for some reason blasts music almost all night....even if almost nobody is outside, the speakers are playing loud music. When there are people out there as well, just forget sleeping. It was like a parade was happening on a weeknight (Tues and Wed) at -am!!! I'll never stay hear again. Even Tylenol PM isn't enough to overcome that ridiculous situation. In my opinion a hotel has no business locating in the heart of the party. It defeats the purpose of a hotel which is supposed to allow people to sleep.",0
 room is small and I could not stretch my suitcase  reception staff was very warm and helpful ,1
 Hotel is not a 4 star hotel it is between a 2 3 star Old and worn furniture dusty curtains Cannot close a window properly I expected a small room but a better standard from 90 night Friendly staff very good location ,0

 This hotel would be lucky to be rated 4 star anywhere other than Europe All you get from the grumpy old doorman is a grunt when you arrive My room was dated with a tiny bathroom I enquired about a late checkout and was told they were fully booked on that day however when I checked online there were 7 different room types available including mine Never again for me  Location was good,0

 Lied to by the receptionist who put us in a standard double room when we had paid for a queen deluxe room His response to the matter when we questioned him the next morning about the type of room we stayed in came across in a very negative tone and we were only refunded the difference in room rate because we questioned it had we have not mentioned anything we would have been charged full price for a room we weren t in As a lover of London I wouldn t recommend this Hilton to young couples as we feel this was the reason we were lied to about our room and our room rate  Good location ,0

"TERRIFYING! The door to outside would not close; could not be locked! There was a fist-hole in my wall and I could see outside from inside. We had to put a dresser against the front door. My mom found a syringe in the bathroom. A large group partied loudly in parking lot 'til -a.m. Guests were smoking in non-smoking rooms; our room stank. 
This was my -- yr old mom's trip and she was terrified and did not sleep at all. It was like a dangerous -rd world country; we arrived at -:-- pm; management would not do anything. Beds old, broken down, bathroom dirty, carpet worn and torn. - nights? No, we checked out at - a.m. and found another nice place for same price. Notified corporate upon return; zero concern. Dangerous, awful, find another place!",0
 The public parking next to it is excessive expensive 49 for one night At the hotel you can get a reduction but it still remains 38  Friendly reception with a glas of cava The terras on the 7th floor with little mini pool is great Also nice to grab a bite there You can even see the roof of the Sagrada Familia from there ,1

 For contemporary travellers with smartphones they really need more plug sockets and in better positions in the rooms The television selection and reception could have been better As a minor point we had told them in advance we were on honeymoon and it would have been nice if they had made some small gesture to recognise this  The staff were brilliant friendly efficient and knowledgeable we appreciated the recommendations of places nearby to eat and visit The room was comfortable and the bed was very much so The location was ideal and the canalfront view was perfect ,1

"This Hampton provides free airport transportation. When I arrived at baggage claim, I called for a pick up and -- minutes later, the bus arrived promptly. The rooms are clean and comfortable - typical Hampton Inn rooms. The breakfast is better than most Hamptons with added variety that you don't see like strawberry's and fresh oatmal. The service is one of the best I've seen. The only advice I would give you is to ask for a room that does not face the main road as it does get noisy. Other than that, stay here if you're looking for a quick stay to and from the airport.",1
"Spend --- dollar for one night. Hotel is currently being renovated, but this is done with Ikea furniture. And the old heater was still present, and it had seen better days....
Allthough it is all resently done, paint was chipping, and one of the carpets was stained. The room was also noisy, this mainly from other rooms. 
On the plus side, it is located within a walking distance of the space needle, and pikes market. So it isn't all bad :). If the prices were a lower this could be decent option.",0
 Nothing  The first day Friday 11th we planned to do afternoon tea in the shard The concierge who looked after our bags gave us some advice about what was around that area and it was one of the best parts of the weekend The beds where amazing and also the breakfasts not many places have a nice cooked breakfast from a hot plate but the Hilton are an example Plenty of choice from the continent too Rooms were immaculate and they pushed ours up the cleaning ladder so we could get sorted quicker The rooms WI FI enabled me to watch the UFC in the early hours of Sunday morning without any buffering at all Much appreciated Customer for life now See you again soon,1
 Not many bad points Towels were little rough had early call on last morning This hotel is very modern very large and in a very central location overlooking houses of Parliament Rooms were modern spacious and good value Had very nice meal in brassiery ,1
 Staff were not pleasant during check in Also housekeeping kept a travel pillow and did not report that they found it as we left ours in the hotel  Buffet breakfast was delicious with a generous assortment and worth every euro The rooms were air conditioned clean and spacious bathrooms ,0
"Conveniently located to Alamo and Riverwalk, hotel staff attentive and fast to respond on any request. Rooms are well appointed (even flat tv), eventhough the hotel is not something very new. Now... here comes the big NO NO... $-- self parking is just unacceptable to me in a what is supposed to be a - star hotel, it doesn't matter where the hell it is, not for hotel guests. Simply because of that (which I believe is a big factor) my rating dropped from - to -. Recommended only if you are willing to pay $-- a day for self-parking.",0
 Uncomfortable bed TV didn t work Location Personally cooked breakfast,0
 One of the waitresses in the restaurant was looking down her nose at me but as I look alternative I get it alot so I m not bothered by it This is the only thing I could I could say that s bad about this wonderful hotel  The facilities were amazing staff top notch comfort and style Food was great clean and new Lovely place will definitely use this hotel again ,1

No Negative The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the room was incredibly spacious for London with very comfortable beds highly recommended,1
 Room was meant to sleep 4 but sofa bed was single I lost energy to complain Hotel was confused because booking com insisted on booking rooms in different names I had 5 kids with me  Comfortable bed great shower,1
 There could have been complimentary bottled water provided in the room 3 for a tiny mini bar bottle of water is a little much especially on Easter Sunday when no shops were open  The view of the Paris rooftops was lovely bed was comfy and the breakfast was delicious The staff were also extremely polite and helpful ,1
 Breakfast was ok a good selection but didn t seem to be enough staff on to replenish empty trays bowls of food or to stick up on clean crockery when needed Had a drink in the bar one night and thought 18 for a gin and a brandy was extortionate and that was with the bank holiday 20 off  Location was good for where we wanted to be Close to tube station Decor in the hotel was different in a good way ,1
No Negative All ,1
 Nothing to suggest Location was excellent for walking and using the trams Very nice restaurants in area of quiet streets and canals,1

 The smallness of the room which was very very basic The closeness to St Pancras station,0
 the room size was just a bit small however they did everything they could to make the rooms comfortable despite the smallish size breakfast itself was outstanding Staff at breakfast were indifferent ,0
 Nothing special about the hotel considering the price Nothing extra at all Crappy tv channels expensive movies spa was always to booked up to get a massage Bottom line all expense for nothing really Ended up buying breakfast because of convenience but not worth 32 dollars Didn t even have power adapters  Comfortable bed and room ,0
 The whole property is outdated and renovation ongoing will most likely not resolve all the deficits It is the former Concorde Lafayette Hotel from the early 70ies or 60ies of last century This is not at Hyatt standards Rooms are extremely small and noisy  Very nice staff at reception Gorgeous view of Paris from my room at 31st floor ,0
 I did not get any sleep for my three night stay due to the street noise that must have come from a bar below my street facing window it went on until five or six A M How could anyone give this hotel four stars It rates one star People must read this review It was HELL  The buffet breakfast was very nice Also the deep bathtub ,0

 Room was dingy very little natural light No Positive,0
 The WiFi signal was not very strong No Positive,1
No Negative the romanian girl to the desk was wonderful and very professional ,1
 The hotel is undergoing refurbishing but not finished yet Though when booking all the pictures of the rooms where the new version However nothing was mentioned about refurbishing I consider it cheating Our room was so cold that we were heating it with that old style hair blower on the bathroom wall We were forced to go to the lobby to warm up there We left several messages at the Front Desk but nothing changed The bathroom felt very warn off and it was impossible to take a shower as the water wouldn t go away  Location is perfect Amazing breakfast As one of us was vegan it was impressive with loads of fresh fruit and fruit salad Veggies Lovely staff so helpful and always smiling Not that it always gave a desired result though ,0
No Negative 5 walk to the underground station Repubblica Only 20 taxi ride from Linate airport Next to the hotel is a huge park ideal for a morning run or a stroll in the afternoon ,1

No Negative Luxury standard of accommodation with amazing decor and the most attentive staff you could possibly wish for ,1
 The decor is very modern No place to put your makeup etc in bathroom No place to hang bathroom towel No seat with a back anyplace practically in entire hotel Beds a bit on the hard side All a tradeoff for great location Location could not be beat Steps from the duomo and across the street from La Resciente the department store with great food and views on the 4th floor Staff was friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and many selections ,1
 At the time of check in the room was clean but smelly The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and the tube station is just so minute walk,1
 I didn t like the room the communal areas were very nice along with the lobby but the room was very cramped and dated the bed wasn t comfortable and even though it was a double room it didn t feel like a double bed my partner and I are slim and we had no space to spare The staff were very helpful and polite and it was the hotel itself which let it down the bed wasn t comfortable and the room was cramped the shower was decent but not enough headroom for anyone over 6ft tall,0
 No real atmosphere Proximity to San Siro Stadium,0
 Nothing really to fault If there had been a bar next to the rooftop pool that would have been superb but it s not an issue  Hotel location is excellent right in the middle of the old town everything seems close by Staff don t fuss around you you can just get on with your own thing Excellent breakfast included as part of costs,1
 Our room was in the last floor where the elevator didn t arrive Although it is described as free wifi it was limited speed of free wifi therefore it was required paid services to have full performance one I think it is not fair say something half true This was not my real decision factor so I cannot decide internet made the choice for me to get the room but I don t like such incomplete purchase conditions to induce things are not completely true  The staff very friendly and professional,0
 The room was to small for 2 people The bathroom was tiny too elbows touching the walls whilst showering The location can be a bit noisy Wi fi wasn t the best stops working in between No breakfast available DO NOT BOOK IF YOU LOOK FOR SOMETHING BIGGER we would not return  The Staff was friendly Location was great Good air conditioning ,0
 Maybe a bit more light in the bathroom wonderful 5 day stay  Bed fabulous AC wonderful Quiet sleeping Bathroom clean and amenities nice The STAFF was exceptionally helpful friendly and kind The breakfast was excellent fresh food delicious dried fruit juices coffee so wonderful ,1
 If compare to price disappointed  Hotel has safety luggage deposit room ,0
 Tiny bed and tiny room called superior double room rip off  Location,0
 The hotel is beyond the zenith of its time The room we had would need some renovation works particularly in the bath room the tiles are starting to become lose The corridors are very narrow and at the time we stayed at the hotel the lift required some repair At arrival we found on a wood covered wall an imprint of what appeared to be the freshly creamed bottom of a previous guest Although we requested to have it cleaned this didn t happen  Very friendly staff the hotel was located close to Metro exit Argentine 2 minutes walk to Arc d Triomphe We had a welcome bar with some coffee and biscuits on arrival later we retrieved some sweets with our key which was nice The room was overall clean At this price the hotel was very good ,1
 Room needs updating Location good for Hyde park ,0

 Nothing really just the room needed a little TLC but overall comfortable and clean and the location was excellent I would stay again  The bed was very comfortable and since we were here for 4 nights it was great Breakfast was good everything you could want for breakfast was there The location was excellent so close to the Gard de Nord station just out the door and across the street literally 3 minutes walk but it was a little noisy at night if you faced out onto the street There were so many eating places around the hotel so no problems there having to travel to eat The room did need a little TLC but overall comfortable and clean ,1
"I take a group of students to NYC every year for a conference and we stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania every time. Why? Because our school will only let us stay at the place with the lowest bid and Hotel Penn always has the lowest bid. It is doable. There were no bed bugs on any occasion, but the rooms are old and in need of repairs. Our room this year smelled terribly of smoke, the AC and fan were broken, the bathroom door didn't close and there was jackhammering outside our window from midnight until -AM every morning. The sheets were clean and the towels looked clean, but didn't smell super fresh. If I had a choice to go somewhere else I would, but given the situation the Hotel Penn isn't so bad that I won't go back again next year.",0
 I have stayed there 3 times before there seems to be no record or continuity no way that they recognised me as being a customer who had stayed several times before that was disappointingNo Positive,0

 As a family of 3 the sofa bed was atrocious Ended up trying to sleep on the floor which resulted in us checking out at 5 45am and travelling home very tired  The location of the hotel,0
 Arrived early and asked to come back and check in at 3pm Came back at 5pm and only 1 room ready Disruption in the early hours on both mornings in the outside corridor and on the second occurrence the police were called to deal with the unruly guests staying in the hotel Not what was expected from 5 star hotel  Location of the hotel was very good Decent room sizes ,0
 the staff were unfriendly at the night shift  the parking was available at site thats why we chose this hotel,0

No Negative Amazing staff Beautiful views,1
 On my first day I was put into the wrong room the reception at the time expressed he has never come across anyone who had the wrong room allocated to them before I didn t like that was made to feel I shouldn t have questioned a situation which I was entitled to He expressed that everything was fully book and I had to speak with someone else the next day I spoke to someone the next day and immediately understood my query and changed my room I was only there for two nights but first impressions count and I wasn t happy with I was initially dealt with Clean and had a good location ,0

No Negative Comfy bed good sized room very clean very quiet despite being so central good breakfast,1
 There was nothing that I didn t like Great little quirky hotel Very quiet clean and comfortable Nicely located for access to the City,1

 The elevators are quite in need of refurbishment The free WIFI is very slow and sometimes unreachable  The breakfast is really good with lots of selections Coffee is standard machines ,1
 Single room too small  Good location ,0
 The fact that the cheaper rooms do not have a window is a bit depressing But the room is still decorated nicely Another downside is that we were on the ground floor and you could hear televisions on in other rooms and people walking down the corridor  The location of the hotel was quite convenient however it wasn t central enough But for what was paid the services were good and the staff try and be as helpful as they can ,0
 price performance  locatio,0
 Weird room layout with a wall of windows onto a mutually shared terrace that was obviously for smokers Necessitated keeping the drapes drawn and lights on all the time Convenient to train station and City sites for our 16 hour layover Mac computer in the room served online and TV watching Nice touch,1
 Both my self and my partner suffer from allergies and discovered that all the bedding was made of feathers It would have been nice to have the option for hypoallergenic bedding  It was great to be able to access our room before the time given to us The breakfast spread was varied and tasted great ,1

 Gym was horrible Location pretty dead after dark  Great rooms and cool vibe ,1
 The road works They started in the daytime and went on until around 6am so all through the night They are going on in the square right outside the hotel and are incredibly loud Really annoyed we had paid for two nights as would have changed hotels The staff did move us to a quieter room for the second night but if you happen to be in one of the rooms with a window facing out then you will not sleep and for the money we paid around 200 a night it was a real let down  Friendly welcome from staff on arrival nice bar and in centre of town so close to the night life ,0

"We have stayed many times at this hotel because of the wonderful staff and great food. Until recently, the rooms were a little dated. However, the hotel just completed an entire remodel. It now has a very contemporary feel and decor.
We were confident enough to have our daughter's wedding reception in the newly decorated ballroom. Our wedding guests had only praise about the look, the food and the professional staff. 
Our guests who booked rooms were VERY pleased with the comfortable rooms, new decor and wonderful staff.",1
 It s not a 5 star The room is dated and there was building works going on which I would like to have known about before I got there and had the choice to pick somewhere else No Positive,0
 We had no room cleaning Huge mistake to me No Positive,1
 They moved me to a front room when I did not like the darker room in rear of building Very considerate  So peaceful and welcoming like being in a private home On check in they give you a bag with all the tourist information that you need They make reservations for tours and add it to hotel bill very convenient There are always snacks and coffee and tea in lobby as well as coffee tea in room gratis ,1
 Nothing Every thing is great and staff very friendly,1
No Negative Location was convenient to tram trolley underground Hotel is directly on the canal so step out your door for dining bars etc beautiful breakfast buffet each morning with eggs quiche pastries yogurt fruit cheeses meats ,1
 The location is near some of the better known nightlife and it may be noisy from outside on weekend nights That s not a fault of the hotel at all just to be aware  Staff welcome and restaurant bar was genuine the food was seriously good and the location is perfect for getting around on foot or tram This is a really nice unpretentious small hotel ,1
 No bath personally much prefer a bath to a shower Seemed like no english people worked at the hotel good location very nice clean room with large comfy bed Good tea coffee facilities,1
 The 4 star rating was misleading to be honest It was clean enough but not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel Some of the furniture had seen better days adjoining rooms were noisy and the room itself far too warm The idea of a frosted glass bathroom seemed a good idea until you needed to use it in the middle of the night the light shines up the whole room which is bad news for your sleeping partner  The location was great staff were friendly,0
No Negative Beds,1
 For the price i was expecting better room and better service  I requested nice view and i got the least nice ,0

"Came to Dallas to see a couple of Texas Ranger Baseball games with two other --+ adult friends. The area is far from the ballfield in Arlington but close to most of the nightlife and restaurants that Dallas has to offer. The pool is small and the gym is marginal, but the amount of space in the suite made up for these small concerns. We paid $---- night which was about $--.-- more then the other hotels offering a single room. The air conditioner worked well enough to cool the entire room. Housekeeping wasn't exceptional, but adequate. Staff was friendly and helpful. The included breakfast was also very good. If I returned to Dallas, I'd certainly stay here again.",1
 The rooms were cold and the breakfast was low quality for this type of hotel  Staff were very friendly and helpful Great location ,0
"We stayed here for a week in early October ---- and they have a serious bed bug problem. Numerous people were complaining about it so we have reason to believe it is in a number of rooms. Having arrived back home yesterday I have a huge number of really serious bites on me and the fun of now worrying that we have brought them back home in our luggage. Seriously, DO NOT stay here.",0

 Only one lift working Given disabled adapted room which was not what we booked and furniture was dated Location was perfect for our trip to Hyde Park concerts,0
 The building work that was going on that we weren t notified of having to walk through very dusty corridors that had danger no entry written on them to get to our room it seemed we were the only ones in that part of the hotel and it was really dirty as around twenty rooms were being referbished and when I say refurbished I mean it was back to the brick walls hence the dust this was not up to standard when we were clean and ready for a night day out  The hotel itself was lovely and in a fab location staff were friendly and rooms were clean ,0
 GLASS bathroom door If you get up during the night the whole room is flooded with light My beauty sleep was disturbed Greatly reduced privacy as the door is not completely frosted over Curtains too high Not easy to draw them together Staff were good except for one member who struggled with the concept that speed doesn t equal efficiency Poor lighting for reading in bed Sorry hotel but on balance we probably will not be staying again  The staff were pleasant and helpful though somewhat over stretched in reception ,0
 We booked a king size room but got a double room although when we complained we did get breakfast on the house The air conditioning in the room wasn t working very well even after being on all night the room wasn t cool Certainly not worth the 230 that we paid for the room  The staff were very helpful and friendly ,0

 Reception staff very blunt Close to Camp Nou Very clean ,0
 I was a bit disappointed with breakfast both quality and selection i expected better To have a room with view on Big Ben or London Eye was only possible when upgrading read pay extra this was not mentioned when booking i do not expect to have the view but would appreciate having the possibility without an extra charge or be informed upfront that i will not have the nice views if i don t pay more we tried 4 different restaurants nearby and they ranked from poor to bad not hotels fault of course limited time for children in swimming pool view on Big Ben at breakfast if lucky with table Overall good hotel in a very nice location,1
 Breakfast starts too late paid for it but couldn t take it No Positive,0
 The room was small and drab It s called a city hotel but it s miles from the city The breakfast which we paid for was inedible and the staff in the restaurant were not interested  Nothing,0
 Room we booked was advertised as a superior however our room was tiny and when I told the reception staff we had booked a superior room we were told that was their base room meaning it was standard Thought they would upgrade us as it s really a little bit false advertising but they didn t although they did move us to a slightly bigger room  Room service food was very good ,1

 Air conditioning leaked into the entrance to the room and was slippery I was with my elderly mother and it was a health and safety issue I did report it I had to ask for more sugar milk and tea bags on 2 separate occasions I think a new way of supplying these essential items could be reviewed  Very friendly staff who couldn t do enough to help Very impressed ,1
 Got asked to leave 75 euro deposit without having much of a choice This has to be at the discretion of the guest  Comfy bed nice and helpful receptionists ,1
 Had to have the window opened all night due to heating that would not go off Despite telling staff no solution to this  Good location reasonable price,0

"When we arrived at the Sheraton the bellman directed us to some more affordable parking that was very close. At check in we mentioned we had a long week with family and were just getting a little retreat. We booked through priceline, so you never know what you're gonna get. The wonderful lady that checked us in upgraded to a king room with an awesome view of the trump building and downtown. The bedding and accommodations were spectacular. We drank and dined in the Schula';s steakhouse that is on property and received remarkable service and the steak tartar and oysters were excellent.",1
 breakfast is the same every day next to the train station,0
 No parking very expensive to park for just overnight and no view from room just a wall Rooms were very homely clean and comfortable and defo would stay again,1
 No air conditioning Nothing,0
 Room freezing as window was wide open when I arrived Tried to warm the room as per instructions only to be told hours later when room was still freezing that staff were centrally controlling the room temperature which seemed strange Heard another guest also complaining his room was cold Noise and vibration from underground trains was very noticeable so moved rooms from ground floor to 2nd floor much quieter  Good location and room well equiped,0
No Negative Sooooooo kindly,1
 The bed was covered in scratches the room was dingey and dark and I had expected a lot better from the photographs The kettle did not work the carpet had holes in it and the furniture was falling apart The Wifi only worked in the lobby I d booked a Supreme double room It was so far from that I wonder what they meant  The bathroom was really nice However I did have to take the plug out with my doorkey ,0
No Negative This was my second stay at The Grande Pigalle for the second leg of my holiday I was a little worried because my first stay was in a superior room but all fears were laid to rest Smaller rooms are still beautiful and clean and I got a balcony as requested This hotel definitely helps to set a Parisian tone with it s decor and architecture ,1
 Breakfast was a lost cause We had to wait in a queue the first morning for 20 or so mins The second morning we waited about the same The queue didn t move at all so we walked away Not enough staff at peak times  The hotel is in a very good spot for the West End ,0
 No hairdryer  The staff were lovely and super helpful The food was superb loved the brunch The air conditioning was a life saver in the heatwave ,1
 Perhaps staff in dining bar could brush up on welcome etiquette Even when busy it takes but a moment to acknowledge a guest obviously waiting for service The chef saved your day for you  Well done Chef Your food was nicely presented but cooked to perfection Will be dining again soon ,1
No Negative The location is excellent Good media center in the room ,1

 I had a need to telephone the hotel before arrival and the member of staff was unhelpful  Breakfast,1
 They put us in a room with dry damp overlooking a building site When we asked to move as it would wake us early in the am they were happy to do so but we found ourselves in a room so small i could not even change In the end we needed to upgrade our room at a charge of 40 Pounds per night to get the same room size as we had on night one A lot of hassle and moving room to room made the stay unpleasant  Location,0
 When I booked back in January for early September stay I was not informed about renovations occurring Air conditioning was advertised however I was told this was not working in my room and I was provided with a pederstal fan It was a very hot week There was no external window  Good location ,0
 The hotel is in urgent need of renovation everything seems quite dated The breakfast is very limited not great choice Everywhere in the hotel there is a strange smell of detergents perhaps to mask worse smells Not too great though  The location is good very near the metro only 2 stops from the Sagrada familia The pool on the roof is very small but still a nice occasion to cool off after a hot day in the city ,0

 Breakfast too expensive for what is offered With 9 you can get a better one at the bar nearby hotel  Perfect hotel for attending a conference at the CCIB Close to the metro and to main bus stops Good location also if you wish to spend some time at the beach ,1
 The most dissapointing trip ever The hotel has the most ridiculous and complicated procedures ever Prepare all the documents for that trip because you don t know what they may need They took the payment for the stay twice and took them 3 weeks to return it If I didn t get help from booking I don t know if I ever would get my money back The director was rude she ignored me and my emails It s a beautiful hotel and fantastic location but It s a great location very nice and clean interiors All the staff but the director very kind and friendly,0
 Wooden floors scrapping chair and pacing heels from above really annoying Hotels must pad chair feet if they want the easy option of wooden floors  Nice breakfast and bathroom was good ,0

"The hotel is very """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""compact"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (very small lobby) but from what I hear most DC hotels are like that. The room was nice, bed comfortable; only complaint was that the air in the room was REALLY dry and the fixtures are a little run down. The staff were very nice and helpful and MADE the stay for my daughter and I. 
Also, we were originally booked at the Rouge on a Snique Away sale but arrived at --:--AM and there were no rooms left so we were put in a taxi and taken to the Helix, room paid for by the Rouge. Definitely not ideal but I guess these things happen and the situation was handled promptly.",0

 Not quite enough hot water Lovely original features,1
No Negative Location of hotel and its 24 hour reception plus friendlyness of staff,1
 Room very small Room very clean,0
 It was generally great The nature of the hotel is that the rooms are very small that was not a problem for us but if you need space this is not the place for you It was a shame that the rooftop bar was not open until the end of April we were looking forward to drinks on the Thames in the sunshine  The staff were so friendly and had a great sense of humour They were a real highlight of our overnight stay The breakfast lounge bar area was really comfortable with lovely river views stunning on a sunny day ,1
 Our room didn t have enough light for reading in bed  It s hard to believe such a central Paris location could be so peaceful Helpful staff Easy to reach from the metro ,1
 I guess thin walls between the rooms I heard everything happening at neighbors room o  Great location Close to major sights you want to see in London Pretty clean ,1
 Position of mirrors and lighting this could improved When applying make up ladies like to sit comfortably I did struggle so I went out and bought a mirror  Staff extremely polite and friendly a wonderful weekend easy access to all locations I would return for another stay ,1

No Negative Possibility of going in and out so easily,1
 problem with cold water supply to the room but fixed after problem was reported to reception  staff were helpful,0
"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. It is very basic and has absolutely nothing special to it. At most this is a - star hotel. The Wifi, like most places is not free --$ per -- hrs and the parking 'oh my god'! --$ per day. you can park in a publi parking oposite for --$ per day.
I would look for another hotel with more character, which I have heard San Fransisco is full of.",0
 London rooms are expensive so the rates here are also not cheap but better value for money  The location is superb Earls Court station is a good hub for District and Piccadilly lines Also Holland Park and posh South Kensington is at walking distance Many bars and restaurants nearby Cleaning is good and the staff is very friendly Rooms are comfortable but small as nearly all London hotels Free fresh fruit and coffee at the reception a big plus for me ,1

 Common space is somewhat narrow and cramped as its an older building but lots of character  The room was AWESOME Very large high ceilings modern and good quality and of course the mini bar filled with wine Each room has a theme Austrian wine maker with full blown photo of bottle on the door Breakfast is lovely Staff are super friendly and not pretentious at all when sharing their knowledge of wine One of our best hotel experiences We will be back ,1
 I tried to use the pool with my fiend but it was taken up by swimming lessons and only two lanes were available so we weren t able to properly relax in the pool as the free lanes were being used  Price and location of hotel Love that the hotel is so near to the tube and shops I m coming back at Xmas with my daughter ,1

 Was given a room which when I walked in was already occupied with somebody on the bed The check in process took far too long Receptionist made it very confusing just because there were two rooms as part of the one booking Rooms tiny compared to other hotels of same rating and price Won t be going back  Location and Breakfast choice good ,0
 Hotel facilities corridors elevators and rooms need so much refurbishment to transfer totally the characteristics of the building from a hospital was original into a hotel 4 stars A lot of noises loud trolleys running in the corridors when housekeepers start morning cleaning Advise don t take a room next to service rooms housekeepers Cleaning of the bathrooms and smells Curtains rusty and need immediately change The Help and professionalism of security guy Hussien who dealt with my complaint at 05 00 am and the shuttle driver was so friendly and connected with guests,0

 When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by  If you wanna stay near paddington in a buget This s good idea But to be honest I wish I just book Hilton instead ,0

 When I requested an iron as they said I could do they proceeded to tell me there were no irons or boards after saying they didn t know what one was I was due for an important examination the next day and needed an iron It left me looking scruffy There was no change in the breakfast for people who had to leave before it officially started Lights came through the window all night Very small room The shower was nice Good location Bed was comfy,0

"I was disappointed that when I booked a package online, the reservation was not correct when we arrived. The front desk informed me that I would have to pay more money if I wanted the package. I had to have valet get the printed confirmation from the truck to prove what I had booked. Also, the valet hit the front of our truck while it was in the garage. They obviously knew it had happened and wouldn't have informed us if we had not seen the damage.
The SPA was Amazing, though. Also, Ellington's brunch is worth every penny.
We will go back, but I will book over the phone next time.",0

"The location is great if you want to be in the Theater District. Within walking distance of everything in that area (Times Square, Broadway shows, Central Park, etc). It was clean. Our room was ready early. The concierge was very helpful. On the downside -- there is nothing really """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""special"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" about this place. I had hurt my knee and asked for ice. I was given a garbage bag and instructed to get ice on the fourth floor. There is no breakfast or coffee. You have to go next door to the deli for coffee - I thought that was a little crazy - especially since it meant having to get dressed. I wanted to stay in my pajamas for a little bit! BUT -- we had everything that we really needed and the price was affordable.",0
No Negative Perfect for Wembley stadium,1
 When leaving staff member asked me to pay for the complimentry snacks which were actually free as another staff member told us when checking in This was a bit embarrassing because she was quite loud and kept saying you have to pay Will be good if they find out the correct information before asking their customer to pay  Hotel was clean restaurants and transport was within walking distance ,0
 The only way the room can become better is to put some plabts ands flowers on the nice little balcony  Staff was really welcoming kind and helpful Top location Will come back Although they didn t speak Italian my girlfriend found it very easy to communicate with the staff ,1

 Nothing really they charged us for a meal which we didn t have However as soon as I said it was a mistake they took it off the bill This is not the first time that this has happened to me in Amsterdam I don t think that they have anyway of checking that you are the occupier of the room you are buying the meal on Now there s a tip for you  The bed was huge and was extremely comfortable The room was modern and clean and the bathroom was excellent The location was great just opposite the main station It was within walking distance of everything really ,1

"Well - I don't expect great prices in New York, but was disappointed with the lack of ambiance and overall friendliness. With - of us, the price was OK to share a room. But they added in $-- per night for wifi, the lobby was frenetic and bar service lackadaisical, decor felt dated. There are definitely better options out there.",0
 Was really disappointed with the room it was tiny just enough room for a double bed because of the pictures on here I feel a bit deceived due to it costing 490 for 3 nights It also smelt damp from the bathroom and it was soo hot I was sweating getting ready we asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked so they sent us a fan instead as there s no air con Wouldn t book again  Breakfast and location were good but that s all you pay for ,0
 Breakfast too expensive Location standard of room,1
 Expensive and disappointing breakfast Quiet clean room,0
 There was extensive building works going on which lead to the reception area not having functioning IT equipment and they couldn t locate our booking for some time and the lifts weren t in use so they had to use the service lifts There was no warning of this on making the booking which is disappointing given the cost of the rooms  There was an event being held in this property so the location was perfect for my CEO and his colleagues,0
No Negative Very small rooms and beds ,0
 The hotel is actually outside of Milano There are buses but not very often and they don t stop really close to the hotel The one which stops closer is until 09pm The room us too small for 4 and there was not a good smell Towels weren t available until we asked for them Breakfast is the same every day nothing special  Price is good for Milano,0

 Worst welcome I have ever had at a hotel but the guy on duty when we arrived Location and decor,0
 On entering the room it smelt musty and as though it hadn t been used in a while not good When attempting to order some fresh milk for my tea in the room was told by housekeeping that it would cost 5 00 a little ridiculous Told there was no fridge in the room and there was On trying to order fresh milk from reception when booking in was not helped just told to call house keeping when it could have been sorted from reception which was a shame as the phone connection was breaking up Just think nothing should be too much trouble it wasn t rocket science after all  The location The car park ,0
 These are two separate hotels The Millenium Hotel that looks like a high standard hotel and the Copthorne Hotel that looks like its poor cousin When I made the room reservation the reservation read Millenium and Copthorne Hotels It was never mentioned that I actually booked a room at the Copthorne Hotel On my arrival the receptionist at the Millenium playfully told me You are at the right hotel but your room is in the other building Copthorne Hotel The difference between the two hotels is quite evident dated furniture broken shelf in the bathroom etc  Quiet Close to the underground ,0
"This is sort of a downmarket hipster hotel in a good location if you want to be in Times Square. Not much to recommend here. Rooms were very tight even by NYC standards, mine had a full or queen bed and it just fit in the room. Bathrooms are also tight and showing wear. I received a note after I checked in that there would be no hot water --am--Pm. Think nice three star motel with loud music and girls wearing Penthouse thirst in the lobby. It may be your thing but it wasn't mine.",0

I parked my car here during an overseas trip. When the hotel employee went to retrieve my car a loud noise was heard and when they showed up the bumper was damaged. They refused to admit they damaged it and were extremely rude and defensive. This obviously happens a lot. I make a report to the police but nothing could be done. The police seem to know them well. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE!! These people are possibly criminal and definitely bed news.,0
 Cost of drinks from the bar were a bit steep  Pleasant staff comfortable room and public areas ,1
 Furniture was very old and beds were not comfortable  Amazing view,1
 There was no lighting just inside tbe entrance The room was nice and clean and the bed very comfortable,1
 The Room for some reason had a second bed or camp bed made up in it so limited the space we had in the room Why that bed was in there I don t know The disco could be heard below us until 3 am Could nt open the window even the 10 allowance Slight smell in room when we returned at night of the drains The beds were 2 singles pushed together and we requested a double bed No Positive,0

 The room could have been bigger room for a comfortable chair would be good  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very well presented but very small The breakfast was very good ,1
 The room is small but functionable  This hotel is modern quirky fashionable and a place you want to stay Great restaurant bar ,1
 The room was small and the condition was average e g The carpet in the room and in the hallway was worn Most unsatisfactory was that the air conditioning only worked when turned to 5 degrees which it didn t actually get anywhere near and only with the fan speed going full blast all night The result was a warm and noisy and not very restful night  The lobby was a comfortable place to sit while waiting for our train,0
 Hotel is under construction excellent location nice staff great breakfast,1
 The dark room which had no closet the self proclaimed art the inaccessibility to parts of the hotel for hotel guests including the gallery due to private showings  I liked the night time staff and the bar The lady at the reception at night helped us a lot and was very kind Another front desk guy helped us when an order was a no show and gave us two free drinks for the bar that was nice The barmen was a pro too ,0
 Nothing This was one of the best hotels i have ever been to and I have been around the world Staff are professional and very friendly at the same time the hotel decoration is beautiful gives the feeling of old english the room was fantastic comfortable will all needed amenities every thing in the room and minibar is complementary not including alcohols all tips are also included in the rate so you don t have to tip any one nor do they expect to be tipped The hotels restaurants service delicious meals There is nothing I disliked it was all great and beyond our expectations Highly recommend and would definitely come back here again ,1
 Beautiful reception area that did not match the room Room was tired Limited plug points One socket hanging off wall I paid the full amount in advance and did not want to authorise my credit card as I had no plans to make any purchases This seemed like an issue and the staff insisted on seeing the card that i had made the payment with I found this bizarre as they had the funds They then insisted in taking 0 01 to put it on the same card My colleague had also paid in advance did not authorise a credit card and was not asked to do this Very strange and a complete hassle when checking in  Location,0
 one thing that the staff was a bit slow when I asked them towels for the pool at the rooftop everything,1

 We had breakfast in the Executive Lounge and would have preferred the buzz of the breakfast room on the first floor The hot dishes looked as though they had been kept warm for too long Our keys failed twice during a 3 night stay Apparently this is quite common I did not enjoy travelling down to the ground floor each time it happened having just travelled up  Lovely spacious room with fantastic views We were on the 7th floor Staff were friendly and efficient and were keen to answer any queries we had ,1

 The room was very small booked a superior room however this was just an average room The shower made a extremely loud noise every time it was turned on The hairdresser was not your average hairdresser and seemed to look more like a steamer for clothes than a hairdresser so was very hard to know what it was  The staff were very friendly and helpful The facilities were very good also ,0
No Negative beds are so comfortable Great hotel pity it rained the whole time so didn t get to enjoy the pool ,1
 We liked everything  The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooftop area was small but ideal for our needs and the view was lovely The rooms are very modern and comfortable The full size fridge was a big bonus Location just perfect We will definitely be back ,1

"We stayed there for - nights - it was clean and comfortable. 
When we first arrived though we were given a terrible room on the third floor which was old, poorly decorated and really, really noisy. 
Luckily my fiancee has worked in hotels and requested that we be given another room (as we had booked a superior room). 
This was duly provided and we were relocated to the --th Floor. The room there was much nicer - with a huge bed and a compact, but nice bathroom. 
We had breakfast the first morning but not thereafter - it didn't seem to be great value.
All in all though we couldn't complain.
Location was fine for theatres,etc. Lots of good-value for money restaurants on -th avenue too.",0
 The cooling system had a leak so there were damp spots all around it and some water was even dropping to the wardrobe and the floor We signaled it to reception but they simply told us that there was not technical assistance during the week end and they did not offer us another room Moreover both lifts were broken on Friday afternoon and after that one of the two elevators was out of order during all the weekend That was a major inconvenience given that our room was located in a 4th floor and the pool in the 6th floor The pool cool but the tiniest I ve ever seem  The location is pretty good in walking distance to Pla a Catalunya the bed is very confortable the terrace is very nice with a cool but tiny room ,0

 I had dinner with friends in the restaurant and was rather disappointed with the smell of old cooking oil that filled the space and the general ambiance of cheap and nasty This was out of character with the rest of the hotel  This was a great location with easy walking access to shopping and sights The room was spacious comfortable and quiet and as a solo female traveller I felt completely secure Nice to have complimentary tea and coffee in the room too ,1
No Negative Friendly staff and had the most welcoming attitude Can t wait to stay here again I could not fault it one bit Beautiful hotel ,1

"I have been to several Doubletree hotels and this one was by far the best. It's not the typical cookie cutter doubletree. One of the front
desk people told me it was converted from a boutique hotel. The room was very spacious on the -th floor and they have those """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""memory"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mattresses that make you want to never get out of bed! The hotel was in the perfect location for walking to lots of nearby restaurants and local establishments.
The staff was very friendly and accomodating with directions and information on the area. The weather in DC was warm in december and they have a great outdoor patio in the front, off the lounge area. Perfect for people watching and having a drink...which we did.",1

 1 Hotel is rather outdated in terms of carpet and furniture 2 Access to the room is rather difficult if you like mazes you actually may enjoy the strange access system 3 I asked for a room with a nice view and I got one at 1st floor with view towards other rooms at less than 20m no privacy 4 No heating during the night it is very cold in the room 5 I asked for ironing service offered by the Hotel but I could not pay it by card cash only  1 Location less than 100m to Stephansplatz and the metro station 2 Acceptable breakfast,0
 Too small and pokey to deserve its rating I m afraid Air conditioning was necessary because even though not particularly warm weather the room heated up very quickly and became stuffy without it It was fine but nothing to get excited about we won t stay there again  Extremely polite and helpful staff nice breakfast good position in 7ieme Comfortable bed ,0

 Unfortunately our room was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel and on Saturday night the noise in the street below was like trying to sleep at a boxing match There is a nightclub attached to the hotel next door a pub across the road and pubs at each end of the street It finally quieted down around 3 30am I advised the front of house manager Tarek Hashish that some triple glazing would beneficial to these rooms apparently this is what is like most Saturday nights and he refunded our upgrade cost which we appreciated  Lovely hotel great location for Covent Garden and the West End We upgraded our room to a superior twin very spacious and comfortable Staff were very friendly and helpful ,1

 My room booking took a long while to come through to the hotel system and I was made to wait close to half an hour to be given a key despite showing the reception desk a booking confirmation it simply took too long Then unfortunately for the price of my room the room was very very small quite unlike the picture I had seen on the booking com website The chopped fruit left in my room was a nice touch but was without a cover and the bathroom was unclean All in all I would be reluctant to stay again at such an extortionate price  I feel the hotel is nice and comfortable when you walk into the lobby The breakfast was delicious and the staff at breakfast were really great Friendly attentive and provided great service with smiles ,0

 It would be nice if we can opt for late checkout around 5pm Also if you can provide electric kettle for each room it would be nice The ambience is good I like the staff and the room eventhough it s quite small Wish I could stay longer ,1
 Staff were ignorant and unhelpful maybe I wasn t the correct type of guest I forgot something in the room and have had no assistance in trying to get it returned or even if they found it it was only a gift so nothing important Lifts didn t work Had to leave a cash deposit at the desk even though we had paid up front incase we stole items from the mini bar which was empty Shocking  Not much to be honest,0
 the parking fee 25 euro per day the hotel price is to much closed windows in the rooms a 10 min call to frankfurt charged 35  nice hotel and staff,1
 The weather but that s not their fault All staff very helpful,1

 all was very satisfactory bed was superb best nights sleep ever,1
 The room was quite small and dark and the bed rather uncomfortable The layout also wasn t very user friendly For example there was no bedside table and you couldn t turn off the lights while lying in bed The week I stayed was extremely cold and the radiator in my room wasn t working so I had to have an electric heater which the staff was kind enough to provide running the entire night which isn t ideal  The hotel location was perfect for my purposes I was working close to Earl s Court and the hotel is just a few minutes from there which also makes it very convenient to get to from Heathrow Staff was friendly ,0
 Nothing Comfortable bed Friendly staff Good location ,1
 Was not such a good experience the hotel is situated on the top of a hill they were very understaffed The one receptionist answers phone calls to take orders for the kitchen and manages the check in at the same time The swimming pool is really tiny not even worth it My shower had no curtain so there was always a puddle on the bathroom floor No Positive,0
 The pricing on the food  The bed was very comfy and I love the speakers in the shower from the tele Was all connected And the views were spectacular,1

 It may have been just our room but I would definitely add another wardrobe or chest of drawers we only spend two nights but someone with more clothes would probably have to leave them in the suitcases  Location is excellent and the hotel provides a great range of services for a surprisingly good price Staff were very friendly and professional ,1
 Very expensive for two nights Gym facilities open late and are poor with machines that could not be used needed to call maintenance to get them to work because something was switched off Terrace pool area opens late at 11am Lighting in bathroom not good  Breakfast was good and location very central to conference centre Staff were friendly,0
 The Hotel doesn t have fitness facilities like a gym steam or sauna These would make our stay very enjoyable the rooms are well maintained and the staff are very friendly and always willing to help,0
 Not a lot of choice and lack of diversity during breakfast Staff was not so welcomed The offer through booking was exaggerated Better book through their own website as it is probably the same price or less expensive  Bed and fitness was OK Location next to a metro station but it takes around 15 min to reach de city with a change ,0
 limited time to clean your room they dont want to clean and tidy up your room at afternoon location front desk staff,1
 The rooms are horrible Very old furniture Broken roof Bathroom facilities are old Towels are of poor material and conditions Pellows are uncomfortable at all No room service They offer you to order from restaurants that offer a delivery Definitely will not come again  The location which is few minutes walk away from the champs elysee,0

 The elevator says that it can carry a total of 300 kilograms however it can barely fit 2 medium sized persons We had to take turns and couldn t take our baggages with us  Perfect location latin quarter kind staff clean and beautifully designed rooms fast internet connection Haven t tried to food there but the restaurant looked welcoming Close to a metro station st Michel and to Notre dame cathedral La fayette shopping center and jardins de Luxembourg are about a 15 minute walk The area is lively and full of restaurants and pubs I stayed for two nights and had a great time there Recommended to couples and small groups of friends ,1

 Some of the staff didn t answer our questions properly We had to move once from the initial proposed room because it was too close to the street At the restaurant the lady that sarves the coffee didn t remember twice our request Overall it is a good hotel but the prices are very high relatively to the value that was offered thereNo Positive,0
"I stayed here recently while attending a conference at the Convention Center. Initially I stayed because the price was right (make sure and check their specials), but so glad I did! It was about a - minute walk to the Convention Center with many shopping options along the way, and I really appreciated the small lobby, little restaurant and friendly staff. Union Square was a block away and there were were many little restaurants nearby. 
The guestrooms are not large, but I was able to get a jr. suite, which gave me more room and I still paid less than the big name hotels were charging!",1
 I did not like the fraud that they committed on my card the day I arrived Do not go here No Positive,0
 Bed was really uncomfortable lumpy mattress and squeaky bed frame Air con unit was over the headboard so blew cold air directly onto me  Great staff characterful fabulous location ,1
 I couldn t point out anything Eating lots of lovely apples enjoyed having dinner at the hotel and great ambience at Breakfast The staff were really amazing and that would make me revisit the facility when I travel to London ,1
 Better if there were coffee tea making facilities and also our room was a little dark as no outside windows  Fab location with a great bar and small swimming area Staff were so friendly and helpful ,1
 Tiny spa facilities a terrible view which overlooked a storage facility we couldn t open the windows and despite the air con it was too warm chipped furniture tears in the carpet and 15 to park overnight  Comfortable bed large bathroom ,0
 The price The room it was down 2 narrow flights of stairs basically it was a fire exit There were 2 air conditioning units one of which we couldn t switch off which made sleeping very difficult Very handy for central Amsterdam Staff were extremely helpful for example we were checking out and left our bags for a few hours and we were offered an umbrella to borrow because if had been raining ,0

"We stayed here for a week in May and really enjoyed our stay. We had a lovely surprise that the bunk bed room we had booked was actually a more spacious room with two comfy singles with an amazing view of the Hudson River and Hoboken skyline. Two large bottles of fresh water were provided everyday.
The area of the hotel is simply amazing with gorgeous apartments and cafe's and bars dotted along every street. We walked everywhere from here! The old style of the hotel is unique and a lovely experience, the staff uniforms are great! Even though the bathrooms were shared they were spotless, constantly being cleaned.
We had a great time taking the free bikes out along the Hudson River opposite and cycling to the Brooklyn Bridge and seeing the Statue of Liberty. 
A great place to stay at a brilliant price, sure we will be back!",1
 The staff seemed badly trained The service did not match the surrounding  Beautiful building very nicely furnished Very comfortable and stylish,1

 Room and check in problem with original booking major hassle Needs updating,0
"This hotel is okay. I would not pay more than between $------night. The customer service is average - sometimes the front desk is helpful and sometimes they were not. I stayed here two nights and on the first night, they only had a double room available. The second night, the front desk staff happily switched us to a king room. The Sleeper bed is comfortable but the rooms are somewhat small with very little walking space. The bathrooms are average. This hotel is more akin to a Ramada Inn than a three star Sheraton. This could be due to the age of the building and it being an urban city location.
There's a lot of things to do in the university area but you must use some caution when traveling on the SEPTA train to-fro. Overall, there are good eateries and bars around.",0
 Each morning the wifi broke and wasn t available for quite some hours The service was italian which means chaotic in my opinion  The hotel is located close to the Metro This means that even though the hotel is not in the centre you can get there quite easily ,0
 The staff at the front desk gave us wrong information about the opening times of the mall The music in the bar on the 13th floor is too loud and not great The Gym should not be that cold  Great location Great rooms and great room service very clean Connection to city metro etc is perfect ,1

The lobby of this hotel is nice but their service was not the quality of a Hilton. The best thing from this hotel is the location and just right outside the hotel there is an entrance to the train. The rooms were very small and the hotel as a whole was out dated. If you stay here you don't need a car being that you can walk to where you are going or simply go outside to the trains entrance. Even as a gold member I did not qualify for free internet or breakfast.,0
 Less rain  The staff are brilliant very friendly interested in you and the reason for your visit and are very helpful ,1

"Located in Japan Town in SFO, Hotel Tomo is a European-style hotel. Accommodation is good, walls are painted with Japanese-style cartoons, which is very fanciful and great for the kids. Very clean and restaurant is good as well. Staff is wonderful.
However, if you're looking for a hotel where you can conduct business online in the morning or evening, I'd suggest going some where else.

 Almost got charged again for the city tax on check out due to a mistake in the system Wouldn t spend money on the expensive breakfast there s plenty of cafes surrounding the area which are much cheaper and better quality  Beds were comfortable and overall finish was to a really high standard location is really good being on the higher floors means an amazing view of sagrada familia ,1
 The reception staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful to all 11 of my guests Having worked on behalf of Radisson in the past I found this quite embarrassing No one greeted us on arrival or helped us with bags and wedding bits The check in systems also took ages with all desk staff finding it confusing no smiles no customer charm and no offer to assist with anything other than complicated check in systems The facilities were fantastic but the staff made what was meant to be a very special time for me wedding time quite stressful and I dreaded having to deal with them  Facilities and room cleanliness,0

Ms. Jacqueline Felix is a great help by email and phone, also the staff upon arrival was great.

Breakfast is up to US standards, not european so no cheese, ham but hamburgers and pancakes. Good coffee (all day) and free water.
Location is close to Madison Square Garden station, nice walk (-- min) to Times Square.

"I loved the location of this hotel. We were in D.C. for pleasure, sightseeing with children and you cannot beat the location. The pool was great for the kids at the end of the day as well as the free movie night each evening with popcorn. I give it - stars because the concierge service was dismal. I tried two separate concierges during our stay and they were both useless. Also, I don't understand the charge for wifi?",0
 Staff were not very helpful and had to wait at least 10 mins before anyone would speak to you plus booked a double bed never got it at all and there was no attempt to help sort it I understand if the hotels busy but why give u the option to book a double if you don t get one  It s was clean ,0

Being in the hotel industry I know a good hotel when I see one. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. We stayed here for two nights and had the best time. Employees go above and beyond to ensure you are satisfied. Everyone was smiling and willing to answer any questions we had. Johnathan at the front desk was very personable and even helped us out with directions to his favorite local beaches and restaurants. The gym is small but had everything needed for a great workout. The pool area was nice- My only complaint is that is closes pretty early (-pm). The complimentary breakfast and drinks were awesome! The room was clean and huge. I can't wait to go back!,1
 Rude staff asking intrusive question very judgemental not very helpful charged me twice for my stay when I had booked way in advance Absolutely disgraceful Wouldn t ever use the hotel ever again I m very wary of using booking com again as my first experience for a special occasion was ruined Room was okay for us to sleep but cleanliness of the room was very poor We found rubbish near bed and dirty crockery We asked for new crockery and the staff were not helpful rude and never brought fresh cups for us No Positive,0

 The milk that was provided was close to expiration and in my coffee I got some white flakey bits The hotel is a little out of the way as Bank is more business district so we had to travel far to find some breakfast as it wasn t included in the room However it wouldn t damper my interest to stay at this hotel again and I would definitely recommend  We absolutely loved the balcony and the big bath It s such a luxury to find a good bathroom in London hotels The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were of really good size Room service was really good too ,1

"+One fantastic boutique hotel experience. The staff was incredible Friendly and helpful. 
They offfered us to pay an upgraded with better price in the check-in to a Deluxe King room and it was massive and beautiful.
+Location excellent, close to financial center, historic Boston and Quincy market. The Blue line t station is right across the hotel's front door.
+ The rooms were very nice, spacious, the bed was very comfortable. We really enjoyed the overall modern design. Bathroom and closet excellent. With a high level of finishes, furniture and facilities.
+ The food at the Woodward restaurant was great.
-Poor attention in details as expected, because it was a special occasion for us and they hadn´t got any detail with us.

 The staff were pleasant enough but not a wealth of knowledge about restaurants and pubs We made our own bookings The hotel lacked atmosphere and seemed very quiet and serious  The hotel is very beautiful and in a wonderful location Our room was very compact probably too compact for our taste ,0
 This time they gave me room 115 and it was awful The carpet had stains everywhere it did not smell fresh the bathroom was run down you can see mold in the tiles and the layout was just really strange There was popcorn walls and ceiling at the entrance overall disappointed  The staff was great The last time I stayed here it was very nice on the 7th floor Usually if you have stayed with them before they usually try to keep your room consistent ,0
"We went here for a meeting that lasted three days. I travel a lot and am spoiled by nice clean rooms. This place stunk of oldness, dust and mold. We would not wait to leave. The beds were very comfy. Too far away from everything! It is very pretty but we will never go back!",0
 Breakfast was same everyday I got tired of that  The executive suite room was really comfortable had enough space and also clean The location was great I think the executive suite of this hotel is ideal for family ,1
 For what is meant to be a 5 star property the property is run down and in need of serious upgrade of the room decor Simple things like curtains on proper tracks that open close with ease would be a good start Hence I think the hotel is over priced when you take room quality into account I have often stayed at the Marriott Canary Wharf and that property is in much better shape Service was also limited I had an airport transfer booked through the hotel but had to juggle my own luggage through reception and out the doors no staff to be seen anywhere The driver came in from the street to assist  Location,0

"After seeing the mixed opinions on the hotel, I prepaid for one night just to test it out. The area is a bit sketchy, since it is right by Chinatown, but I felt alright walking around even during the evening. I think the homeless jut minds their own business and won't come and bother you. The price is really good and there was also complimentary breakfast. The best thing we found was that a water fountain with good tasting water was on each floor, this saved us a lot of money for buying water!
The rooms are a bit old, but clean. 
I would stay at this place next time I visit because of it's great location, so close to Union station, as well as the friendly staff.
If you are not looking for something fancy, this is a good choice for you.",1

"The Whitehall is noted in Frommers Chicago guide as the most romantic hotel in Chicago. We booked on that recommendation. To say the least our group of - was greatly disappointed. Firstly, the hotel looked tired. Secondly, the service was sub standard with minimal concierge service, which proved frustrating as it was Valentine's week-end and an early booking would have avoided significant lineups resulting from a late reservation. Thirdly, there was no hot water (apparently a broken pipe). ALthough such an occurrence is understandable, the service response to it was incomprehensible. Lastly, the front desk mixed up the bills charging my brother twice, notwithstanding I provided a separate credit card and expressly requested that it be charged separately. Chicago is such a fantastic city, don't ruin it by staying at a sub standard hotel. There are so many fantastic alternatives.",0

 This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone  The room was perfect Staff were fantastic very helpful and couldn t do enough for us we forgot to lock our safe one day and nothing was touched Would recommend this hotel to everybody,1

 I am not sure how this hotel has received a 4 star rating The hotel is run down and needs a major renovation When you check in you have to pay at time of check in The front desk is very casual and not at all like a hotel The rooms on the street side are very noisy The bathrooms are old and need major renovation and rooms are old an tattered The carpet in hallways needs to be replaced You can stay at a much nicer hotel in a better location in Barcelona  The staff in the restaurant were very accommodating when requesting vegetarian food The location was a short walk to the pier,0
 Pleased to say everything was good Great fairly quiet location near Tower Bridge and the Tower of London but close to Underground station so less than 30 mins to most attractions including shops Ideal for exploring the locality and history of the City Keepers Restaurant within hotel was excellent and good value for money Rooms have everything we wanted liked the free safety deposit box and hot shower Staff very pleasant and always pleased to help Second time we have stayed here so that in itself is a good recommendation ,1
 Housekeeping Beds and pillows not comfy Very poor and bad lighting in living room Hot corridors Location is perfect,0
 Swimming pool on roof very small Staff were outstanding,1
 I have stayed here over a 5 year period now and the room was starting to show and feel a lack of investment It felt worn and ever so slightly as though it needed a deep clean The same is true of the corridors The location is excellent and the service unfussy so it is easy to come and go,0
"Because of the car trouble I had to stay at this hotel. 
I admit, NOT all La Quintas are same. 
This is first one, where I would not stay even for free again.
Semi trucks parked all around the property blocking --- spaces at the time, when the dog show is in town, and management couldn't tell drivers to park at much bigger parking lot near by? Bad management. Dirty rooms? Bad management. I was checking out when guest was complaining about the same things. No blankets? The old paper thin throw was a bit thicker than bed sheets. Bathroom was looking just as rundown, with patched up holes, scratched bathtub... place is not getting any handyman's attention. Bad management sucking all the money out without doing any upkeep.
Go and stay for few bucks more and get a good night sleep and enjoy the stay.",0
 Not much Just window view from room 518 I think that s my room I felt breakfast should have been included in stay  Front desk staff where excellent Loved the roof top bar and pool Great location Thanks,1
 No tv in the room Bathroom was so small No Positive,0
 The gent at the reception was most unfriendly I would almost say extremely unpleasent and most unprofessional  Location and proximity to Metro ,0
"Our usual hotel isn't as new or as fancy but for $-- a night it includes a spacious room, - queens, breakfast, internet and parking. Thought we would spend a little extra and check out a - star hotel. The self parking is $-- - $-- for valet, breakfast is not included and average price for room service is $-- plus you have to pay for internet. We also had to load two babies and all of our stuff through two elevators and a long hallway since we couldn't afford a bellhop. For some this may not be a big deal but for a budgeting military family its breaking the bank.",0
 Not very clean inside the room s and the room s are like a 2 hotel  Not worth 4 ,0
 Hotel rooms could do with some refurbishment bath tub was cracked  Great location very friendly and helpful reception staff ,1

No Negative It was a great location Very helpful staff Rooms were very nice and comfortable Would definitely stay there again ,1
"I've stayed at this property over the decades thru many name changes. It is as good as it gets in this area of town. All rooms have a fridge and microwave.
Rooms are reasonably clean - and most have recent upgrades of furniture and carpeting. The bathrooms could use a major redo - but that may come soon.
Continental breakfast is perfectly adequate in a nice big clean room behind the front desk.
The staff is super friendly - a big plus - and will take care of your needs.
Wireless internet can be iffy in some rooms. If you require access - ask at the desk - - they know where the better rooms are.
If you can stay without maid service for a week - - - Their weekly rates are super.
Lupie's Cafe is close by for a bite for lunch or dinner.",0
No Negative The location it self was wonderful,1
"We have chosen the Marriott Marquis in the past when visiting Times Square. This trip we wanted a smaller hotel and the Renaissance was just right. Spacious room, nice sized bathroom. Modern and clean. Great concierge service. We enjoyed appetizers and drinks in the R Lounge overlooking the city. Recommended.",1

 Chasing refund of deposit expensive breakfast No hot chocolate in the room Poor pillows no iron no refund to my deposit of 50 so still having to chase a refund,0
 The room was extremely small and the sheet and towels seem not very clean No Positive,0
Pay attention to your credit card statement! We were charged FOUR times for the same weekend stay! Each time they charged our card it was for a different amount - each amount over $----.--. It took three days to clear up this mess - we spoke to several different people including someone in the corporate office. They were all unapologetic and very disorganized.,0
 Honestly speaking furniture bathroom bed carpet the hotel facility and room condition is old the price of room is high  Staff are really nice very helpful big size room good surrounding 15 mins walk to metro lots of restaurants good convinence location,0
 Room was small and had no desk to work at and although I booked a soundproof room I woke up the first morning from the person above me showering  Bed was comfortable airconditioned room was well appreciated shower was very good as was also the breakfast and last but not least the staff was really friendly ,1
"Concierge was not too friendly though he did provide the necessary information as written in his manual. Other staff was nice and friendly, specially the car parking valet and the maid for the room. Took time to figure out the room heating and the service guy was warm and friendly and helped me figure it out very well. Would stay again for the central location and good value for money for the rooms per night. Valet parking is expensive though as compared to other hotels nearby and I was charged $-- for the third day since I picked the car after - pm, they should not charge hotel guests atleast for the day they check out or atleast until evening of the day.",0
 Bad attitude for female staff hot air conditioner Location and decor only ,0
 Nothing really Just right for what we needed Away from the hustle and bustle but near enough to the beach and city sights if wished Loved De last rambles for locals not to be mistaken for the one starting at Christopher column bus statue ,1

 Dirty carpet in room Stains on sofa in room Hot water not working at bathroom sink and could not be fixed Also appeared not reported internally for repair before next guest check in Was evident when I raised this at check out TV sky card not functioning so watching tv not possible Location perfect for accessing Kings Cross and St Pancras,0
 No bar in the hotel or mini bar in the room Wasn t a big problem as the location is close to many pubs and restaurants  Great location quiet room Very close to the metro Area is geared towards adults but all in all it was a great location ,1
 Kitchen cutlery missing seemed weird But we ate out most of the time so wasnt a huge inconvenience But as they advertise a kitchen it should have the basics to eat with  Great service and good breakfasts Clean and modern with all the facilities Easy access to metro and city shopping etc The Kitchen let them down as NO cutlery and two plates So couldnt really use the kitchen It is modern with ceramic hob and separate bench top grill even pots and pans But no knives or cutlery to eat with ,1
 Limited facilities for business travelers  Excellent central location in one of the top districts in Paris,0
 No teamaker in room No seacurelock No Positive,0
 Service for breakfast was unbelievably slow so the charge was deducted from our bill However there was nothing wrong with the standard of the food Apart from this slight complaint I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel  The fact that the receptionist unhesitatingly gave us a different room after we had complained about noisy neighbours ,1
 No decaff coffee on the hospitality tray Easy walking distance from station and shops,1

No Negative the aircondition was broken and leaking water in the room,0
 Room very small and cramped Bed squashed against wall which wasn t ideal for getting in and out of bed It felt like being in a tiny caravan Our city view was a view of the rooms opposite so needed to keep blind down for privacy hence making the room dark Hardly any staff around very minimalistic no tea and coffee facilities in room although a mini bar with a few very strange drinks that were not to our liking The bathroom was a toilet and shower in a cubicle which wasn t very private and the basin was in the bedroom Very bizarre hotel and not certainly worth the money  Quick check in,0

"This was my second stay at the hotel. Stayed here based on a previous experience. First stay was great, but I left somewhat disappointed this time. Here are the reasons why:
Pros:
Executive Level Staff was Super Friendly, including lady who does breakfast
Easy to find
Comfortable Beds
Cons:
Hotel needs an upgrade (workout room, restrooms in room, etc)
Staff was hit or miss on being helpful. Front desk attendant my last night was short when I asked for a wake up call for example. Made me feel like I was a burden.
I want to give it a third try but may look else where next trip.",0

 Double bed was two singles pushed together so a little uncomfortable but otherwise no problems  Staff extremely helpful and let us use printers for free for airport boarding passes Also fantastic views from our 14th floor room Very well priced for what you get ,1
 Very expensive room rate Paid 500 night with breakfast Chauffeur driven complimentary transport to and from the tennis,0
 breakfast needs to be partially ordered or something I didn t get it and left after a long wait  close to some main points of interest in the city,1
 The room was very small and was dated in the decor Not worth the high price tag  Chosen based on the location of the event I was attending ,0
 The room was described to me as a suite upon check in so I accepted it sight unseen However it turned out that it was just a badly laid out over sized space with a filthy and threadbare carpet and scruffy furniture Plus despite repeated requests the teabags in my room were not replenished Certainly not worth the 160 euros per night I paid for it No Positive,0
 no fridge in room location,1
 Excellent hotel normally however this is a one off had it not been for a quick turnaround from the previous guests they would have normally spotted a broken glass in the bathroom Also the breakfast tray didn t have any croissants as they had run out Staff need to more understanding of their guests as their English isn t brilliant Manage was very nice though  Fab location gorgeous designer hotel love the interior too easy to get to ,0
 Shower was blocked which flooded the bathroom The air con unit only blew out cold air so was cold during the night Bright green led lit up whole room so had to take key card out to turn it off  Good location clean decor was good,0

 They could consider not charging for late checkout if there isn t anyone checking in immediately after we were offered a 2 hour complimentary extension and would have been charged 20 euros per hour thereafter Hotels that have comp ed my friends and I because the room in question isn t booked back to back have always left an impression on us  Gorgeous contemporary decor extremely friendly staff from electrician to front desk ,1

 It was a terrible experience We got robbed as we were checking in at the reception desk There was no security guard at anytime nor doorman We had to wait for the General Manager to check the video cameras Clearly he could see how this thief went thru my purse in front of these hotel employees He said the hotel was not responsable for my stolen valuables It became very suspicious when both employees at the front desk claimed they did not see anything After seeing the thief in the video clearly we thought otherwise Afterwards I was sent to the Police Station to make a formal claim I do not recommend this chain of hotels No Positive,0

 The room could have been larger Breakfast was a bit mean  Location convenience for Royal Albert Hall and tube ,1
 The sockets were not general European style but Italian which made impossible to plug in any appliances The only one available in the room stopped working after an hour It was very noisy outside of the hotel throughout the night and the windows were not double glazed  The location is great next to the cathedral Lovey and helpful staff ,0

 I had an unpleasant incident in this hotel Some money from my wallet have dissapeared when I left it in the hotel room The hotel s manager considered that is normal for hotel s guests to be stolen I had been left with a bitter taste after this hotel accommodation and of course with the manager s apologies I Recommend to the future guests to take care of their personal things in this hotel No Positive,0

"We were in town for business . Some man begged me for money while I was sitting inside the hotel lobby. Complained to hotel management and I was blown off. They wanted to give me a free upgrade like I would stay at this hotel again.
 The wireless Internet service in the lobby is very slow . The area is not safe at night and the outside lighting is very poor. If you are sensitive to noise avoid this hotel. We could hear all the traffic and city noise ( people screaming, sirens and people blowing car horns) all night long. Guess they never heard of sound proof windows. 
Beware of your surroundings and walk in groups.",0
 The staff is completely un supportive the TV was not working for 3 days room not cleaned well the flush of toilet not working We complained many time without any response and when they responded it was just we will inform the manager Only the location,0

 the female staff at the reception were horrible check in time was above 20 minutes the receptionist that did our check in was not welcoming not smiling did not even look at us and was talking to her colleague in a foreign language while we did not know what we waited for totally not respectful also at check out we found out she had mistakenly or not over charged my credit card without permission and non of the staff was able to give us a refund we were VERY disappointed did not feel welcomed AT ALL  the room was clean and in good shape the location is good ,1
 There is no food to eat in the evening I had to order pizza from outside  It s a extremely modern hotel with fully high technology facilities Highly recommend to young couple ,1
 On arrival in the room there was no kettle had to go to reception to get a kettle The toilet seat was broken and when i discussed this and asked for a reduction in the bill The hotel was 175 per night the reception staff and duty manager said that a reduction in the bill would not be possible This type of service for a hotel charging 175 per night is frankly appalling and i will not be stopping there again although the location and many other aspects of the place are ok  Good location,0

No Negative Nothing,0
 Check in took me almost 45 minutes hotel did not accomodate our request of having connected rooms or adjacent ones although we made a request for that three weeks before arrival We had to wait for the staff to try to find rooms in the same floor finally they located two rooms located away from each other No in room kettle Or coffee making facility Toilet seat was outdated and stained Reception staff need to be trained to deal better with tourist when taking room access cards to the reception to be reprogrammed in the very next day of arrival he insisted that we pay for the stay immediately and would not wait till the of the stay as other hotels usually do although we were staying 6 nights and they already had our credit card information  Free wifi Cleanliness,0
 Poor daylight in the rooms because it is not possible to open blinders  The location is super The accommodation and the breakfast are excellent You can park your car for free in the street next to hotel parallel City center is easy reachable by metro which is 3 minutes walk from the hotel ,1

 room is a little bit small no free wifi  perfect location clean bathroom,1
 Room cleaning was very poor only linen and towels are changed the floor wasn t even swept dirt from outdoor was left and therefore spread around the room Staff was not friendly at all Not even looked at you whole talking  Location is close to Milano Centrale railway station which is convenient for travel but therefore not calm due to many migrants wandering around Breakfast is sufficient Due to early leaving in the morning we ordered two lunch boxes which were provided ,0
 Our rooms were not cleaned very well our bedding was not replaced each day the bathroom was only cleaned once during our five day stay One of the lights was broken making the room quite dim  Good location round the corner from the I Amsterdam Van Gogh museum and ice rink A fair walk into the main centre though Lovely view onto the river and nice and quiet lots of privacy ,0

 Very puzzled that for the price breakfast was not included Missleading add No Positive,0
"Immediate first impression is of an older hotel in Key West. Must be the plantation blinds that make me think of that. The rooms are in a little disrepair, but that seems to be due to their age rather than poor upkeep. That said, the management seems to be trying but can't seem to keep up. Patches on drywall and carpet that doesn't quite extend under the moldings make it seem like quick rehabs are the norm. Otherwise it was clean and has a great location near SeaWorld. The outdoor pool and restaurant were really nice. Don't miss the Firefly restaurant. It was perhaps the best meal I've had in San Diego.",0
 Staff seemed stressedNo Positive,0
 The breakfast was exceptionally poor Looked like a shortage of staff lead to a lack of everything Had to wait so long for the rest of breakfast to arrive that what we had already selected was cold None of the staff were friendly seemed impatient with being asked where things were The eating area looked very tired had been down graded to a cafe with wooden stirrers instead of spoons Left feeling as though we should have eaten out The pillows on the bed smelt of cigarette smoke which we would have changed had it not been so late when we realised Last time we stayed we really enjoyed it that s why we booked again No Positive,0
 Deluxe dbl room too small No view or inside the building Room far away from the lift Money blocked on the card without asking me first And they were not for the room  The bed extra comfy ,0
 Very small rooms and the ac is not operational  Breakfast was decent Fresh fruits and a variety of hot and cold options,0
 Breakfast could be a bit chaotic with inadequate seating after 9am The Bar also wasn t open as often as it should have been  The location of the hotel was excellant it was a great base to explore Barcelona from Staff were generally very good and we loved the central garden layout which helped created a quiet atmosphere despite the hotel being only a stones throw off Las Rambolas ,1
No Negative Convenient location and brilliant price ,1
 There is nothing I didn t like about this property It s absolutely perfect  From the moment you walk in you re greeted with a friendly happy face and the staff never cease to look after your every request until you leave They have mastered service So helpful to organise things for you and give advice Such genuinely friendly people The food and bar is also amazing They even have Cristal I loved staying here I hope I have a reason to return one day ,1
 Location was poor There is very little nearby Taxi cost to areas of interest or airport are very high Front desk staff on arrival were not very friendly Had no permission to use room phone other than in house calls  Modern and clean ,0
 Just one voucher for wi fi connection per room Incredibly mean but this seems to be issue all across Vienna either connection fee of 25EUR day or limited number of devices Still very strange for 21st century  Good location in the 19th district of Vienna nice vicinity with vineyards Very helpful staff rich breakfast ,1
 Bit expensive to use each time we visit London but then you get what you pay for as they say  Staff were super friendly and helpful Easy to get to 02 Spa facilities lovely ,1

 Shame my breakfast was not included in the price which I thought it was at the time of booking My fault though I should of checked Still a good price though  The staff Your staff are amazing truly amazing nothing was to much trouble they were all so polite engaging and had a sense of humour too If I had another opportunity to stay I would not hesitate what so ever I work for Costa Coffee and I know how challenging it can be to deal with the public so well done Holiday Inn Wembley ,1
 My mom and I liked everything your establishment offered and I have already recommended your hotel to three friends  As an expert in etiquette and protocol I enjoyed the handwritten note with the welcoming note next to the dark chocolate tablet signed by Peggy Your hotel met our every expectation thank you ,1
 Room was tiny for a Hilton hotel Location is good,0
 To be charged 23 50 euros for breakfast which was very poor to say the least I m referring to the cooked breakfast the selection was always sparce the staff had to be asked to replenish the bacon egg etc and when they did they produced about 3 rashers of bacon In my opinion the breakfast was very very poor especially for a very very high price The other gripe I have is regarding the lack of coffee tea etc in my room I presume the coffee milk etc was coming out of the maids wages as she failed to replenish those items Will I return to Amsterdam Yes but I won t be staying at this hotel  The staff were polite helpful and friendly The room was okay ,0

No Negative Friendly staff nice room and great location ,1
 Difficult to find my room which was in a separate wing Came in late and tired and got lost Signage IN the lift as opposed to outside would be helpful  Great location near Charing Cross Tube and less than 5 mins from the theatre we were going to Very nice Terrace Bar on 1st floor Staff helpful and friendly ,1
 Location 10km from city centre finding free parking takes time A functional hotel which provides exactly what you need nothing more nothing less ,1
 The surrounding area is not the best though the proximity to the Gare du Nord with direct connections to Charles de Gaulle Airport made up for this Also breakfast was pricey at 15 euros We purchased pastries at a lovely patisserie across the road instead  This is a comfortable clean and well maintained hotel very close to Gare du Nord The staff were very helpful ,1

 Booking com advertised its rate as 40 off when in fact it was the standard rate Beds were too small as only doubles available No Positive,0
 We were very disappointed by a policy that was not evident to us upon booking the room SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME The rate on an individual night varies by as much as 20 to 50 pounds per night dependent solely on the discretion of the hotel itself It was explained to me by reception that it varies solely on how busy they are NOT on the rate that I thought was locked in upon reserving a room I would not book here again simply because of a lack of transparency  The bar on the ground floor the location to shopping and the tube stop at Baker Street ,0

"I was in Washington for the world bank summit and was late booking a hotel so I ended up in the Four Points by Sheraton. While the price per night was elevated, the hotel room was average, had a bad view to the rear of the building and had an air condition which roared like a jet engine. The restaurant on the -nd floor was serving a rather uninspired dinner and the bell man organized a taxi for me to Dulles airport and obviously called his best friend for the trip who charged me more than the usual -- dollars. summing up, the hotel is not a premium hotel, staff is doing business as usual and the restaurant was not worth mentioning. Will make a reservation at another hotel next time.",0
"I wasn't sure what to expect from The Pod. I had never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before, but my -- year old son, who was my travel companion, was in love with the idea of having bunk beds. It worked out great! 
The Pod is located in an older building which has been updated to very modern stylings. We had a bunk bed room, which was quite small, but made good use of the space. The shared bathrooms were always readily available and in good order. They also have an open rooftop which made for a unique dinner one evening! The rooms were generally clean, however it seemed that the carpet had not been thoroughly swept. We had one one small maintanence issue with the in-room safe which was quickly attended to.
Overall, the stay was very nice.",0
 BAD air condition to be more precise it is not an air condition it a JOKE we stayed in one bedroom apartment the thing that they called air condition is ONLY in the sitting area Do you imagine a bedroom with out an air condition Homeless around the hotel dirty carpet and small rooms Good location and proximity to science museum shops restaurants public transportation and Park ed la villette,0

 The fact that we arrived at 14 58 and they didn t let us check in until it was 15 00 was a bit disturbing What could possibly happen within 2 minutes Check out was at 11 Staff at first was a bit abrupt We had a balcony and we couldn t use it because the key was missing The price could have been lower but that s London  Cosy modern room Comfy bed In overall clean and nice hotel Although staff was a bit abrupt at first it proved to be very helpful ,1
 Chaotic check in Room wasn t ready at 2 30 pm Then were given a room which had been assigned to other guests already We had booked a family room 35sqm for couple our 14 year old granddaughter but were allocated a very small double room c 18 sqm in which a camp bed was being set up when we arrived Bathroom was the tiniest I have ever come across in a hotel No other room was available Very uncomfortable first night We were given the type of room we booked the next day and after repacking our suitcases were moved  Remaining two days were fine A good sized familiy room well equipped clean and comfortable Bathroom was still very tiny Good location Staff were overall very friendly even while having to cope with the rather chaotic check in ,0

"This hotel is just east of Michigan Avenue and ON the river which I consider a great location. I'm assuming most of the rooms and public areas have a river view which can be spectacular at night with the city lights. The hotel is of course clean, upscale with rather large public areas including a bar and adjacent Shula's steak house. The rooms are very nice and probably average size and are showing minor evidence of wear and tear. I had a very short stay here for business and would stay here again if I could get a good rate. Didn't eat here, exercise here etc so can't comment on that. Just LOVE the location and the views! If I came with kids I'd stay at nearby Embassy Suites and save this hotel for business or couples travel.",1

Rooms were clean and so were the shared bathrooms, and the location of the hotel was very good. Had we not had the bed bugs experience we would probably have recommended this place due to good value for money.",0

"This was not for me at all. Right off the bat, when you walk into the lobby to check in they had music playing so loud I really thought they had some sort of party going. I could barely communicate with the check-in staff, it was a little silly. The room was freakishly tiny, practically touching the head and foot of the queen size bed with a flat screen tv hanging over the foot of the bed because there is literally nowhere else for it to be. The shower was terrible, one of those with no door or curtain, just an angled wall so the cold air wafts in over you. The toiletries are nice (bliss brand). I'll stay here if its the only place in midtown available, but it is not my first, second or third choice.",0
 breakfast was disappointing for a 4 star No freshly made to order stuff like porridge ommlettes kippers etc No better than a premier inn breakfast  rooms were lovely,1
 Bad smell in the old building they should let any new guest satying in it until they solve this problem specially when we asked reception to move they were very welling to do and some confirmed the that smell is really bad then why from beginning you let us stay in Some of the elevators was not working all the time though maintainence kept fixing them all time but even though they fix during day long and it broke down during night for nearly three days  Staff was really friendly and helpful ,0

"We were there for New Years. We found the staff exceptional!
It is a busy time for a nice hotel in San Francisco. I think the hotel goes beyond the call of duty to try and make the guests as happy as can be.
The rooms are clean and the beds are great! As the hotel emptied out for a couple of days after the holiday, there were no problems with elevators or the regency club. In fact, we found the Regency club lovely and it has a beautiful view of the city.
The hotel is starting room renavations soon.
The Union Square location is fantastic! Close to everything!
We found managment lovely and would come back in a minute!
We had a group of four rooms, each and everyone of them had a beautiful view, all were clean.",1

"Booked a Penthouse Suite because of Photographs on this site. Photographs shows a lovely room with a beautiful view of the skyline. The depiction also stated that the bed would be kingsize. When I arrived the bed was a queen and the room looked nothing like the grand room I was expecting! Thank God I got a great deal or I would have been really upset. I am not sure which room they photographed but I certainly didn't get to experience the luxary I thought I would. Maybe it was because I showed up in jeans and a backpack that I was given a subpar room. As you can see from the photograph I added, it does not look like a suite.",0

"We stayed at the Solamar (-st time) because of location and a notation on Travelzoo that it was one of the top --- hotels in the US. NOT! Most everything we experienced was very average, We were most troubled by the fact that almost everyone staying there had one or more dogs with them and were everywhere. If we wanted to stay in a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pet"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Hotel, we would have one ourselves. There was no information warning us that pets were everywhere and had been in all rooms. The noise from the pool and patio bar was very disturbing even after the supposed closing time. The evening wine tasting was enjoyable and we got a dog show as well.",0
 service especially upon checked in at the reservationNo Positive,0
"Been to Chicago many times and love Michigan Ave. Booked this hotel with HotWire which gave it a - star rating.
Negatives:
Dark room, small bathroom, thin walls, dirty room (glass rings on tables), old sheets, checkin counter not overly friendly, bathroom products not fully stocked, thermostat not accurate, no resturant (a bar is not a resturant).

"I planned a surprise trip to Chicago for my girlfriend to ask her to spend the rest of her life with me. I can not begin the explain how Eden, our conceirge, made our expience the best. Eden suggested great resteraunts on multiple days while offering to do so much more.
Eden went out of her way on one specific occasion and truly exemplified the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Whatever..Whenever"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" motto of the W Hotels. We asked if the hotel had a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""white noise"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" machine to loan as we are use to one in our room at home. At the time, the hotel did not have one but they went to - different stores in the Chicago area to find one! I was so impressed and would never expect someone to go to such lengths to made our trip so special.",1
 The 8 43 fire alarm unsure if it was a drill or accidental especially as the check out is before 11am I really feel for the price it should be by 12 earliest  I liked the overall feel good fixtures and fittings and catchy design The staff are amazing and so friendly Such a special stay even if it was for one night ,1
This is an older hotel but cheaper than others surrounding the area. The walls are very thin and the first night of five was not very quite due to partying young adults but staff addressed the concern. Walking distance to downtown but parking at the hotel can cost up to $-- a day for VIP and $-- for regular but cheaper than all the taxis an parking in downtown. The hotel gave us VIP but gave us regular price. There is also free wine from --- but no breakfast. There is a connecting coffee shop who has a small selection of breakfast items. Rooms are small but I didn't use but to sleep and then was downtown the majority of the time. Be prepared to wear good walking shoes as downtown has a lot of hills.,0
 Our room was dusty staff forgot to give us towels one day when we asked the reception for a new deck they promised to do in 10 minutes however we only received our towels on the next day after we called again besides that its an ok hotel to stay in while in Ams  Beds were comfy rooms are quiet staff is nice and helping No balconies ,0

 Airconditioning only blowing hot air Requested double bed got 2 single beds next to each other Cleaning see foto s Pencil markings on the wall tiles hard water stains on the tiles behind the shower head stains on the tiles next to the toilet To me this equals poot cleaning standards Electricity sockets hanging from the wires Upon request for an iron I was informed that I could get one from the concierge after 09 00 Since I was there for business I left every morning at 8am  Location,0
 I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and have never had a hotel with staff so disinterested in the customer We did not once have a smiling welcoming staff member from start to finish no idea about location of theatre even though it was marketed as one and you felt like you were a nusisence if you asked for information The hotel is lovely but they do need to invest in training as the staff lack basic customer service skills  Room spacious and clean,0

"Our track and field team stayed here for - nights while participating in the regional AAU track and field meet in San Antonio. This by far is one of the worst hotels that I've ever stayed at. Our - night stay here was absolutely horrible, the complimentary breakfast was a joke on the second morning they ran out of syrup for the waffles, and the coffee had a weird taste like perhaps they used the same water in that was used in the bathroom sinks. The toilets barely flusehd in most rooms, and one parent even had to move out of here room, because the toilet ran over everytime she flushed it. And to top it all off, the hotel ran out of clean towels after the -nd night.",0

I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Bring your woolies though coz San Fran is sooo cold!!",1
 The worst hotel I ve stayed in recent years We booked three rooms and paid by credit card five months ago When we arrived the receptionist only can find two room records but cannot find the 3rd one They asked me to call booking and said it should be booking s fault When I used the phone in the reception I requested to check the room in their reservation system again They found that the room we booked had been checked in by others Wrong guest stayed in our room used our booking records Though they found the mistake they didn t apologize to us and let us wait for a long time to get another room So rude staffs it s really bad experience in London  None ,0

"I stayed at the Days Inn for two nights as part of a Contiki Tour. I found the location to be out of the way since we had to take taxis to-from the Gaslamp district. The room was average, the cleaning service was practically nonexistent and the made-to- order breakfast was terrible. But the front desk attendants were very helpful and there is an excellent, excellent Japanese restaurant called Mine Sushi (---- Midway Drive) in a small minmart within steps from the Days.

"Just spent two nights in LA and the JW Marriot was a nice fit. The hotel appears to be only a few years old and certainly in great condition. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. So much so that they opened the house store after hours to get me some Aspirins after I asked them where the nearest convenience store was. I also found the rooms well appointed and the towels were soft and body friendly. I would recommend staying there just don't walk more than a couple of blocks away as the terrain changes drastically with the homeless, graffitti, and trash.",1

"It was our first visit to New York and we decided on Hotel Metro after extensive research. It was everything we expected it to be - reasonably priced, great rooftop view, convenient location to Penn Station, Empire State Building, Times Square and - block from Macys. A decent complimentary breakfast is offered which keeps you going for a few hours, the staff were friendly but not overbearing. In New York you are never really in your room so all we wanted was a comfortable bed, good pillows and a clean room-bathroom. The hotel met all our expectations,would definitely recommend!!!!!!",0

Couple of calls and emails, then I got the reply that online reservation can't be canceled, or can be canceled online but no refund (my cancellation was two weeks ahead).
I live at Asia so online reservation is easier for me, but i think even for people live in States are also used to online reservation. If that is a pre-paid without refund, it shall show clearly at final step (or any step) that this operation is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""not refundable"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The system did have this information but in separate """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""term and condition"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or not-obvious position.
The manager refuse to admit any fault they might have.
the online reservation system is just like a trap.",0
 A bad start with an arrogant unwelcoming receptionist The lift was not working with 5 floors to climb and I did not feel well The room was over heated and air conditioning not working Unfortunately you can t open the windows as the hotel is on a high traffic avenue Reception had no idea how to control the temperature nor did they make any effort to help except for shouting at us One of our worse hotel experience ever  A great location if you like off main track atmospheres ,0

 Room service i e bed making bathroom cleaning was not finished until late afternoon which was unfortunate as I had returned to the hotel hoping for an afternoon nap before going out again in the evening I have used Booking com previously so booked again through you in rather a hurry and had obviously agreed a price I would never have accepted had I double checked I have found The Wesley to be good value for money whenever I ve stayed before but certainly not this time If we stay overnight again in London I shall try a different booking service and also other hotels  Good breakfast with plenty of choice,1

 The bed linen had not been changed as we discovered having returned after being out to celebrate our wedding anniversary The bed sheets were marked and there were many obvious pubic hairs throughout the bed The pillow cases smelled of previous users There was nobody available at reception to raise the matter at the time 11 30pm so we ended up sleeping on top of the duvet The following morning we made a complaint to the manager and were subsequently offered a refund of 25 which is unsatisfactory We have photographs of the incident but have not currently published these  Leaving it ,0

As soon as we walked in we knew we would not be disapointed. The staff was helpful and nice. The room was very clean. The bathroom needed updating but it was clean. We found out that it was scheduled to be updated soon. I have to say the bed was the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. We had a great night sleep had a free hot breakfast and were back on the road in the morning.",1
 We were given a very small cramped room with a view of a wall from the window It was very claustrophobic and when I asked if we could change rooms I was told that since we had booked through booking com it was to be a standard room but I had actually received an upgrade to that room I hate to think what what we would have got without the upgrade I explained I always book through this means and have never been allocated such a room in this hotel We did get a change of room it was smaller again but you could at least see a bit of sky from that window  I liked the location as we stayed a few times before ,0

 There was dirty underwear from a previous guest so I m not sure how clean the room actually was also the reception takes a very long time It took me 15 minutes to get my bag from reception when we went to collect them We didn t have breakfast there as the price was shocking for what you were offered The bed was so uncomfortable that both myself and my husband have terribly sore backs  I liked that we were not bothered and we could get a tram back to city centre easy enough ,0
 No air conditioning This was almost unbearable in London s summer The table fan provided little respite from the stuffiness of the room  Location was excellent We watched 3 shows and it was a breeze walking to the theatres especially Lyceum getting food before and after the shows Covent Garden is a stone s throw away Tube stations are reasonably close by It takes 10 15 minutes to walk to Charing Cross Embankment Covent Garden stations ,0

"Fairly quiet, which was surprising given that they were in the process of building a brand, new wing. Nice, clean pool area. Helpful staff. Convenient to downtown trolley and good dining. (The hotel itself has decent food as well.) The electronic amenities worked well for me. I was there with a group of people, although I had my own room; we were attending a conference in Charlotte together. Given the pleasant experience and the rather low price, it was an excellent value. I do suggest making reservations directly with the hotel because it can actually be less expensive than something like hotels-dot-com.",1

 Room wasn t cleaned properly The very helpful staff member who assisted me with contacting my bank in Ireland in the early hours of Sunday morning following the theft of my money credit cards and mobile phone from my handbag within 24 hours of landing in Amsterdam the theft did not occur in the hotel but in a local bar I found all of the staff I encountered at the hotel to be very friendly and helpful,0
No Negative Good location for short stay tourists but a bit noisy via the street for a long stay or light sleepers You are close to the action but that means there is lot of associated noise,1

 This time the rate included breakfast and I took it however go for breakfast was not a good experience 2 Orange juice machines not working No glasses for juices Another coffee machine was not working either If the breakfast is self service everything has to be working perfectly I usually use this hotel in Paris The location is perfect,0
 The Internet connectivity was very bad I had to postpone my meeting due to the break in connectivity The staff was good very helpful and courteous,0
 The airconditioning wasn t working because it was not high season The room was quite hot at night so it would have been better if it was at least working for a few hours to cool the room down in the evening  The staff at this hotel were all friendly welcoming and knowledgable The location is a little out of the centre but it is easy to travel in by metro or taxi and it is quiet at night so it s easy to sleep The spa and the roof top pool are fantastic and there are lots of areas to chill out in and get a snack or drink I d recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality hotel that isn t directly in the busy tourist area ,1

"This hotel is definitely not a ---- star hotel. I would rate it more along the lines of a Motel - with a really nice lobby. Our room had stains on the walls, smelled like smoke, the bath tub was cracked and peeling. Our neighbors kept us up until -am drinking and carrying on. When we called the front desk to ask for extra blankets, I had to call back - times. And - hours later I received the blankets. It was about midnight at this point. I was ready for bed long before that. My husband and I were just very dissappointed. This was supposed to be a special weekend. I have always heard good things about this hotel, but I would say for the price anywhere else would be better!",0
 I have gone to this hotel a number of times and i have come to the conclusion that through Booking com you get an infieria service in this hotel I always seem to get the worse rooms and only in this hotel I always use Booking com and I have never had a problem in all the other Hotels I have been Maybe booking com should check this out No Positive,0
"Pros:
- Shuttle to and from the airport leaving every half hour
- Very nice front desk staff
- Free parking
- Free wifi and business center
- Clean room and very comfortable bed
- Waffle House a - minute walk away. -- hours with good, inexpensive breakfasts.
Cons:
- Ventilation system was amazingly loud. Had to turn off the system to get some sleep.
- Room overlooking the pool was also loud. Pumps at the pool run constantly.
- Water pressure in the shower was awful. 
While it's a good business-oriented hotel, I don't know if it deserves such a high Trip Advisor rating. If it was the summer, the loud a-c system would cause me to avoid the hotel.",0
 Room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs Location of hotel is fantastic particularly small kids who don t want to spend too much time walking we had a great weekend break,1
 Extra bed was not comfortable Neat bath room lication,1
"I stayed at The Colonnade in the beginning of May. I was very disappointed. The room was not cleaned every day and the bath products are generic. Room service and the restaurant are too expensive. The rooftop pool was not open and they refused to let me go up there to look at the view and write in my journal. I tried to call my home telephone answering service several times, but was not sucessful. At check-out this experience was going to cost me $--.--, but the front desk person took it off the bill. The only positive aspects are that the hotel is location in a very safe area of Boston and there are great restaurants and take-out places to eat at. Most of the staff was pleasant.",0

 We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an extra 20 euro a night which we jumped at So was very shocked when we saw our superior room was tiny and had not been decorated in a long time The price we paid was rediculous for the room we were given Dread to think the size of a standard room I phoned reception to check we had been given an upgrade I was told yes and their standard rooms are even smaller The bathroom was tiny and the shower was terrible We spent almost 500 for 2 nights and the room was a massive let down We paid half that for 2 nights in Rotterdam at NHow and the room was out of this world  Bed was comfortable and room clean Staff lovely and helpful ,0

The greater City of Detroit is honestly exactly as bad as you fear. Stay away from most of it. But here, you are in a specially designated DMZ. A poorly-designed monument to the cement industry, to be sure, but it truly is a well-guarded safe haven. And the view of Windsor, Ontario in Canada across the river TO THE SOUTH is stunning. That's right, Canada is South of Detroit. The bar can be happening, the breakfast buffet is good. You'll stay here. You have to.",0

The bus guy was excellent. he was professional and very friendly since the weather was so hot. The location was outstanding and everything was within walking distance. I will stay at the Paramount again while visiting New York. Thank you for a wonderful experience.",1
"Reading other reviews I wonder if I was in the same hotel. I found this hotel to be nice, with an extremely nice front desk staff. Yes my room was slightly dated, but it was nice enough. Bed was extremely comfy, good a-c, nice large flat screen tv's. The upgrade suite made it even nicer. Location to the airport can't be beat especially if you have an early flight like I did. 
The hotel is under renovation and being converted to a Doubletree. So a bit of construction going on. But I enjoyed my stay. 
And there are PLENTY of restaurants in the area, as well as one attached to the hotel. 
I will definitely be back if the rate is competitive and I have another early flight out of Hobby.",1

No Negative Brilliant location with well appointed and comfortable rooms Friendly and helpful team and wonderful breakfast the on tap drinks and snacks are a real bonus too ,1
 On hindsight we would have paid a bit more to stay somewhere more central Elaboration Parking at this hotel was 20 per night Not exactly cheap But because the hotel was not that near to city center and we didn t want to take public transport we drove out Parking in city centre was not cheap either and we paid another 25 for parking It was time consuming to find an empty parking lot in the city too So we say unless you re ready to take public transport choose somewhere more central and leave your car at the hotel  The hotel is clean new and modern just how we like it ,0

 Been to TDC since 10 years and have seen it go down little by little stuff not being repaired toilet seats minibar Shower showed some corrosion I am used to get a parking place offered by the hotel Not in TDC which costed me EUR 72 3 days Breakfast is extraordinary expensive better go the bar down in the street The bar area is not really inviting put in a corner In the past the concierge came to help me out with the luggage now not anymore And that all for the same price as in the past EUR 130  Accross Estacio Sants makes voyage easy,0
"The experience was just ok. We paid extra for a view of the pool, but we just got a view of a palm tree blocking the pool. oh well... better than a parking lot or a dumpster. The most memorable part of our stay was the vent above the shower which was a portal to adjacent rooms. We heard conversations from our neighbors and then the odor of whatever weed they were smoking next door started to fill our room. At the end of the day, we were sure we were staying next to cheech and chong. Welcome to California, I guess.",0
No Negative Breakfast very nice,1
 Indecent haste to clear our breakfast table when we had not finished our meal but had gone back to buffet for something more to eat This happened on each day We returned to the table and had to reorder beverages and cutlery We found this rather annoying as we could not relax because the breakfast was otherwise excellent We felt the pricing was rather steep for tourists with no company to pick up the expenses tab We would love to stay there more often but could not afford to do so  Staff excellent and very attentive Reception welcoming and efficient Our room was just about perfect for our needs and very comfortable Location ideal for a tourist due to the proximity to the Tower of London The views from rooftop bar superb ,1
 The Rumpus Room very loud and pitch dark take a torch  Fantastic staff great room and lovely toiletries ,1
 Everything Nothing,0
 It s feeling a little tired and may be left behind by comparable 5 in the area I have stayed at previously Great location helpful staff ,0
 Noise B fast only to 9am Room atmosphere very casual ,0
 Meals and snacks are all provided by room service so it s a little different from the usual hotel with a dining room and bar Also there is only one key per room and no front door key So access is always through staff a little clumsy Because the front door is always locked  Location is great steps from Sloane square and Kings Road The rooms are beautiful Staff are very attentive The decor was marvelous ,1
 Bathroom was looking a bit old and could do with updating  Location was excellent Comfortable beds ,1
 Location and it is in between two derelict buildings no shops or other eating places round about Fine is you hire a car Metro and train stations easy too navigate Back rooms back onto train stations and u can hear them  Nicolo very helpful at the front desk public transport good Resturant food at night not good ,0
 Rooms red make over No Positive,0
 Not enough staff queues every day for check in out Not enough bar staff to serve No restaurant only Japanese  Facilities are good except for lack of restaurant during my stay,0
 The breakfast is too expensive 20 for what they offer Just go out in the morning and find a caf  The hotel is splendid and is very near the Rathaus U bahn station so you can move with ease around Vienna Some bars and restaurants nearby ,1
"This was a great find. We had planned on staying - night, but my husband's business got extended. We ended up staying a week, and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or nicer, especially the manager. We started out in a Queen room and were moved to a larger King suite when we extended our reservation. Both of the rooms were extremely nice - I wouldn't have a problem staying in either room again. In fact, we are staying there again this week, and really looking forward to it. Their continental breakfast was abundant every morning - delicious muffins and pastries. There were many wonderful restaurants in the area. For Italian I especially recommend Filomena - - blocks over on Wisconsin. It's affordable for lunch, but quite pricey for dinner.",1
 Bedroom needs decorating Location for RAH good,1
 Nothing  Location and room size,1
 Had to pay extra for breakfast the dining area was noisy from chair making a noise on the floor staff did not seam to know what they where doing Toilet blocked and was embarrassing to say at reception No Positive,0

 Room should have more amenities like a kettle and complimentary water bottles Great staff location,1
No Negative An aristocratic hotel beautiful traditional The place to be after the opera Fantastic cafe ,1
 low water pressure small TV and without free smart features these could be better for the high price per night The 15 pounds per day credit is superb and is a value added perk The location is perfect for shopping and for the British museum visitors ,1
 Air conditioning did t work And it was 33 Had to open windows but it didn t help much Breakfasts are poor the stuff was not quick to react on absence of products  Coffee is good They have welcome drink Location is very good a lot of restaurants metro is 5 min walk Louvre is in 20 min walk Rooms are small but cozy and have everything that is needed except for the iron and iron desk ,0
 The wi fi was working only on one device phone at a time using the password they give you  The room was nice big and clean The breakfast was various and good including cakes croissants and fruits The location of the hotel is quite good is very close to the train station Bruzzano 3 min and you can reach city centre or change with a metro But you should watch the train schedule because the trains are coming at an interval of 30 min Also the metro station is at 10 12 min The price is good for a 4 star hotel ,1
 It s certainly not a boutique hotel the staff were of the quality of a one or two star hotel Definitely not good value for money One of the members of staff suggested that a breakfast in opportune as they only have five tables for 39 rooms The porter on arrival said give me bag not please can I take your bag No Positive,0
"We stayed in a standard room (Valentine's weekend: $---.--). It resembled a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cell"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with a flat screen TV. The window had a cheap pull up blind. The light from a spotlight on a neighboring property easily came through the blind, lighting up our room like it was daytime. We called the front desk around --:-- AM to see if we could change rooms. No answer or answering machine. Then at -:-- A.M., somebody went into the room next door. We could hear the door open, their footsteps walk across the floor, etc. Later, we could hear things we did not want to hear. Finally fell asleep around -:-- Am. What a disaster. Apparently what is left out of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""brochures"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is that they want you to have the cheap motor court experience but pay a whole lot more for it.",0
 Housekeeping could have been better There weren t many vegetarian options on the menu either which was a but disappointing  The beds were comfortable and the rooms were lovely I liked the free welcome drink as well That s was a nice touch I really liked the roof top smoking area as well It was pleasantly quite as well A little out of the way from Amsterdam but the metro is within walking distance and the shuttle bus makes it even more convenient ,0
 They never stated they had building work going on they started drilling under my room at 8am  Location and room was good ,0
 Please refer to the Obote Location is not bad but underground sometimes closed Stuff is doing what they can a little disorganized rooms are ready very late and if you surprise them by returning early to the room you may find out it was not cleaned If you really look close you see that the maintenance of MY room is poor but the bed was comfortable and the room spacious,0

"I'm just about positive the elevator never worked (as my mother said). I did at least have help carrying my luggage up the floor flights of stairs (probably because I'm a lady). However, I was offered a room on the first floor but when he showed me the room I gasped, it really was a closset with a bed! I decided I could use the exercise an chose the forth floor room.
If your just looking for a CHEAP (not inexpensive) place to just lay your head, its the perfect hotel, just make sure you have your days plannned to be full so that your to tired to notice the room and most importantly, bring a couple roach bombers and-or foggers so u don't bring any stow aways home with you (mites, scabbies, lice, roaches, fleas, etc.)",0
 Overpriced breakfast  Rooms are very nice and clean bed so comfortable Personnel is helpful I really liked free shuttle service to Canary Warf ,1
 As above Excellent situation Good hotel but the carpet in our room was really grotty If that was cleaned my score would have been higher,1
No Negative This was an excellent choice The location is ideal close to an RER station and just 8 minute walk to the Tower and Champ de Mars The staff was incredibly friendly and with attention to detail The room is impecable and the bed is very comfortable I was there on Easter Sunday and they even left me a note and a few chocolate eggs as a welcome souvenir This is a 300 a night room and I was upgraded for free to a 400 a night room and only paid 186 due to a promotion on Booking com,1
 Free WiFi is slow I think it should be improved a bit  Location is great Very close to Museumquartier and few stops away from Mitte if you arrive with the CAT The hotel is hidden between two streets hence it is very quiet ,1

"We stayed four nights recently at the Fisherman's wharf Hyatt. Very nice room with large bathroom. Seemed quite clean. Pool wasn't large and was a bit crowded, but nice. Very good exercise-fitness facility. Great location. Several small breakfast places right across the street and within walking distance to cable car stop and street car-bus lines. Hotel staff very helpful with directions and help with public transportation. Would stay again.",1
 The restaurant is very tired and needs a makeover It could be so much better with it s views and situation and better food  Room reasonable restaurant bizarre ,0
No Negative The price of the hotel for the New Year s was more than reasonable Very close to the Tube walking distance 10 minutes or you can catch the bus right in front of the hotel The staff was awesome Breakfast was worth 10 pounds Swimming pool and gym Free wi fi in the room Restaurant and bar with welcoming staff as well I will definitely visit this hotel again ,1

 Hard beds and we were In an executive room Also the sound proofing between the rooms was terrible so over all I had a poor nights sleep The breakfast was rather lacking in choice as well with no hot options what so ever which in the winter was rather disappointing  Great location,0
 The limited food selection in the menu at the restaurant and somewhat high prices for certain dishes  The positive attitude friendliness and good attention to details of the staff and the general management of the hotel ,1
 The hotel s site promises more than actually happens For example we Saw no glimpse of the promised bathrobes The staff were very friendly all the time and willing to serve,1
 Staff in executive lounge were not positively helpful Asking for something seemed an effort on their part Tray left outside an adjacent room all day until we asked for it to be removed  Very handy for Wembley stadium Pool area was very good Room was very good Executive lounge was good quiet space Restaurant was very good Reception staff were helpful ,1
 Only a small point same CD including Amazing Grace every morning during breakfast Never my favourite track  Central location possible to walk to all main tourist spots Helpful staff quiet room ,1

No Negative Walking distance drom St Pancras Reasonable price Quiet place ,1
 Rooms too small No chair Comfy bed,0
 I felt the cheese and yogurts needed a re think to keep them cooled and fresh for the continental breakfast On the first morning my friend s wrapped cheese had gone greasy with a speck of mould and on the third morning my yogurt had started to turn BUT it is a lovely setting and the cereals meat fresh juice bread fresh fruit and decent tea and coffee are a great start to the day so lots more positives then the slight hiccup  Gloriously soft pillow and a slightly firmer pillow and fresh sheets and towels every day Great location with a taxi always available just outside Well stocked mini bar The cleaner left a bookmark on top of my newly purchased books one morning and I was so touched by this thoughtfulness ,1
 We arranged early check in to arrive and discover our room wasn t ready 2 hours after the normal check in time We then arrived at our room to discover that despite paying for an upgrade to the privilege suite we were given 2 single beds in a standard room After approaching reception and raising the issue we were then told we would have to wait another 2 hours for our actual privilege room to be ready So had we not raised the issue we would have been given an economy room unbeknown to us but having paid a suite price  The rooms were very clean ,0
No Negative The Location,1
 Our room wasn t ready and it took a long time to get help from the front of house manager although he was brilliant when he came to speak to us It was not at all good to have to ask three or four times before coffee was bought round at breakfast A self serve system would have been much better  I liked that when we had a problem the front of house manager made sure that we were really looked after and the problem resolved ,0
 The card is not smart we tried severals times and asked the staff manager to help us she was in sooooo bad attitude what she said was show me how you open the door like you are STUPID What amazing happened is that this room 107 actually had been arranged to some other guests and she was still focusing on she opening the door with pride SHE OPENED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OTHER GUESTS ROOM and then we explained to her at that time she was still so impatient and finally she realised her mistakes and gave us room109 This is the worst experience we have in Booking JUST HER TERRIBLE OTHER STAFFS ARE GOOD Btw our bike was stolen in front of the hotel in 10 meters far soooooooo bad feeling DISAPPOINT Good luck with you guys No Positive,0
 The free wifi didn t work at all unfortunately For a Hilton we though the room was a bit tatty such as the uneven carpet we were in room 541 plus the window view was a bit uninspiring ie a brick wall I know it s London prices but I have stayed in fantastic boutique hotels for the same price so you can t help but be a bit disappointed  Very friendly reception staff clean rooms,0

No complaints about the service. The room was clean and quiet... but overall a bit disapointing for the price we paid. The room was a bit tired and just a tad shy of being seedy. The loby was very loud. I've stayed at much nicer hotels in Boston that cost less.,0

"First, let me say that the front desk staff is gracious and working hard to make everyone's stay enjoyable, and the room """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""looks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" great. Unfortunately, staff goodwill can't keep up with the hotel's deficiencies.
We couldn't get the room temperature cool enough; it hovered around -- degrees consistently despite turning the thermostat down to --. And the fan blew day and night, no matter the temp. Family members reported the same issue in their rooms.
The roof leaked adjacent to the outer wall.
The breakfast at the hotel restaurant (a very substandard serve-yourself buffet) was $--! Bland scrambled eggs, sausages that tasted like sawdust, blech. The only edible items were the fresh fruit and toast. Not much for $--.
Potholes in the parking lot. If you're not watching where you're walking, it's treacherous.
I have to believe there are better options in San Antonio that this.",0

 We have been here twice before but this time we came our room wasn t clean and there was dirt on the bathroom floor Also scuffs on the wall The air con made an awful noise all night so we didn t have any sleep We won t be visiting again We have been twice before and our 3rd visit was very unsatisfying  I liked where this hotel was located,0
No Negative Loved the hotel I will definitely use it again ,1
 There was a leak from the air conditioning that woke me up at night and also left a wet patch on the floor right next to the power plug where I was recharging my phone Also the door of the shower is faulty and a lot of water comes out from the bottom  Great location Staff are nice Breakfast is ok ,0
 The elevator was slow and difficult to find The location,0
 Not a complaint but did make me laugh First night I had 2 hotel provided sweets on my bed the following 2 nights the same but they used my own sweets  Location was main reason I chose it which proved to be perfect I also as a female on her own I felt very safe The staff were all friendly and helpful I have stayed in a few in london and this was by far for feeling safe ,1
 Air conditioning wasn t working and to have the window open was very noisy Very convenient to use underground which was cheap and easy to use Spa bath was nice and view of station building from room 1106 was impressive ,1
 This hotel was rated as 5 stars but in my opinion was closer to a 4 or 31 2 star hotel  Location was excellent Near bus stop and shopping around the corner,0
 Only one point when we went down to breakfast in the Keepers restaurant I was expecting some of its own honey that the restaurant was advertising I was even expecting some honey in honeycomb form but all we got was a little pot of Tiptree honey Don t advertise something if it s not on offer  Clean room Very good facilities in the room Bar area nice and relaxing ,0
 Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant Bar staff were attentive and service great,0
 parking can be difficult the hotel is good clean and in a handy position,1
 A bit expensive Rooms are a bit small but that is the case for pretty much everywhere in London  Location cleanliness friendly staff,1
 Shower was filthy even after requesting it to be cleaned there remained pink mould around shower fittings We had tried to extend our original two night booking by one night prior to our arrival but the hotel somehow managed to mess it up we ended up sorting it with the unfriendly but efficient reception staff on arrival however we only got two out of the three complementary continental breakfasts we had been promised for our third night  Good location next to Bermondsey Street cafes bars etc Breakfast staff were great 6th floor family room was quiet and comfortable ,0
 Layout of the hotel very cumbersome need a guide to find your room Comfortable bed friendly staff multiple sockets helpful,0

"I stayed here for a Convention. Service is quite good, they have a free shuttle service that can take you to close distrance places. The hotel is far from downtown, close to Cherry Creek Mall; nothing good close.",0
"Me and my husband stayed at the Inn for - nights, and just loved it. Im rather picky but this was awsome. The interior is great, and I think one off the best thing about this hotel is that nobody gets a brickwall view, all the windows point to the street. Wonderful to have kitchen in room, saved us on bartaps and we also bought some breakfast food, that we ate in our room, and then went downstairs to grab a cup off coffee and a muffin. Staff was friendly, informing, helpful and interested in helping out.
Location is perfect, just next to shawn, ----, train station and in walking distens off everything. Highly recommended!",1
 The ac was useless It was a hot week in vienna and it only gave more hot airNo Positive,0

 The reception guy at afternoon shift keep calling me about my baby My baby was 15 months and surely she was crying  location is quite good ,0
 The room was worse The shower leaked Staff is not really interested We got a big discount of Booking Com but probably the worst room of this hotel  The location Right in the centre and close to the metro ,0
"My husband and two kids stayed there for three nights in June. Very nice lobby and modern simple """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""zen"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rooms. We were directed to a T stop at south station by the front desk when there was one closer across the street from the convention center. Would have saved some time. I also experienced the maids leaving their carts outside in the hall near their closets - which was right near the rooms on the way to the elevator. We would leave the room in the morning and it was still unmade when we arrived late afternoon -- then the maids came to clean and we had to hurry and change so that they could do the room. Courteous door staff and garage.",0
No Negative Warm friendly staff Tasty breakie Super comfy bed,1
Bich was a very excellent host with what I believe is the fastest response time for any airbnb. The house is very clean and everythings in excellent working order. Highly recommended airbnb.,1

-. Greyhound station next door
-. Homeless milling outside the Coffeebean in the morning
-. Homeless in the area at night (throughout the day for that matter, but this is a San Diego problem, not just related to this hotel)

No Negative We had an excellent meal in the bar lounge,1
 Much too expensive parking was 24 00 overnight After spending that much money on a room parking was just too expensive plus the cost of the minibar where a kit Kat was 3 50 Also leaving 100 00 deposit made it very very expensive cos you don t get the money back for 4 5 days  Location was the best thing,0
 no refrigerator you need to walk for about 10 15 min to reach the centre of Oxford street we stayed for 7 nights and in two of those the cleaning was not satisfactory leaving the cleaning towel on the bathroom floor for example Julia was really helpful friendly staff the bus station in front of the hotel between two underground stations Tottenham court and Holborn ,1

 location make me feel more like an Ambassador member Cash advance facility not great No newspaper very clean,0
 A bit pricey Sofa bed very uncomfortable for a child At the price we pay we should have real glasses in the room not disposable plastic I took a while for the check out with only two staff processing people leaving in the morning In addition more than a day later I still did not receive my copy of invoice through email and the hotel overcharged me by more than 67 euro once I check my credit card statement Not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel  Excellent breakfast very good location ,0
 Very warm roomNo Positive,1
 food choice at the bar was below average and not very good when it came the room was bright modern with good facilities,0
 The bed is very uncomfortable I have a back ache in the morning The pillow is only one which is very thin and uncomfortable Usually if the hotel is 4 star it includes at least 2 comfortable pillows and bed No complimentary tea or coffee in the room No small shampoo or soap in the bathroom The lady who clean the room just pass by and just put the toilet paper The room is not clean and tidy What is the idea of coming in and showing that you clean and actually is not cleaned and tidy  The staff are good The room is spacious ,0
 No supplementary water No iron No scale There was a streem of ants in front of my room Only one slow left is availabe Bathroom door is glass and cannot be locked The location is near the rambla metro station The lighting is brighter than other hotels ,0

 The rooms are dated and the brakefast was cold The bed was brokenNo Positive,0
 The only thing was avarage was the wi fi It was complicated to get on line  We liked everything from the kind service of the staff the high class atmosphere everything ,1
"Our family stayed here for - nights in early December as part of our USA vacation from Australia and had an excellent experience. The staff were welcoming and friendly, the room was a good size and The parking next door was easy and convenient. We loved the heated outdoor spa and pool - even in winter. The hotel is in a good central location to San Diego sites provided you have a vehicle and a GPS ! Very close to Fashion Valley mall. The on-site little store was also very handy. Would fully recommend this to all travellers and vacationers.",1
 They could do a Hot Breakfast Proximity to King s Cross,1
 terrible team specially the bad humor of the spa supervisor Free Spa limited to short period in the morning breakfast extremely expensive In front of hotel there is a nice coffee shop that worth much better Shower always changing temperature from very hot to cold  Room size and localization,0

 The access door was broken so I had to wait for someone to let me out with the pushchair most of the time this was quick but sometimes they left me waiting 5 10mins for a member of staff to be free to open it to get in or out Hopefully this will be fixed soon Breakfast was lovely most of the staff were friendly and helpful,1

No Negative Great hotel The room was very large Every utilities you need The perfect room The tram station is just outside the hotel and you can get to the center in 15 minutes ,1
 Chose this hotel due to the parking it was not made clear that the parking was 45 for under 24 hours I have stayed in many London hotels previously booked through booking com none have charged that much most don t charge at all  Comfortable rooms and good central location ,0
 That we wait for the room until 3pm then when we get there the room that we got is ready for family so the luggage staff have to close it  Not so clean the room and so slow to check in,1
 I do not think that the Hotel should be rated 4 stars sorry Our room was definitely NOT a 4 stars Also we asked for a twin room and we did not get it we had to make 2 beds of 1 Location is not ideal as quite far from City Centre although Vienna transportation is simply AMAZING  Friendly staff very clean nice Bar and restaurant attached ,0
No Negative The hotel itself is a bit outside of the main city centre but very accessible with the tram lines located just outside the hotel The staff particularly at reception were extremely friendly and very helpful The free Wifi was quite good and the rooms were a decent size for European standards ,1
 Noise from cooling units outside of our window Paying extra for upgrade and not getting all that was promised Unable to sleep poor lighting will never stop here again  Nothing,0
 Unless you need to be in Ealing there s no particular attraction to the location It s a brisk 15 20 minutes walk to the nearest tube station or a 6 cab ride Noise from the floor as guests arrive late and no sound isolation of room door at all Bed a bit narrow  Good room Complementary nespresso biscuits and water Excellent wifi Good value for money ,1
 Not ideal for those who prefer showers Rather limited choice on breakfast menu  Very comfortable bed Lovely big bath ,1

 Housekeeping was not good The restaurant for evening could do better at making single travelers feel less singled out I don t want to be seated in the middle of the room or to the side when there is clearly an empty table by the window they did clean off the table but then I was not provided a wine list as the tables with couples were etc etc clearly they didn t feel I should have the same service as a couple does Too bad because I think more and more people will travel alone Breakfast bar was awesome Concierge was terrific Good recommendations for restaurants and best way to get to ,0

 Was all good couldn t find fault to be honest A real good bunch you got working there very friendly and naturally down to earth I had a great time ,1
 We have stayed several times at the Hotel but on this stay were allocated a very small room I asked to be changed if possible and the desk staff found another standard double room which was only marginally better Be warned if the room numbers have double zero eg 2008 as there is only squeeze room around the bed on two sides and no room for two suit cases We have travelled around the uk and Europe for 15 months and were not impressed by the room size A disappointing stay  The location to High Street Kensington tube station and parks ,1
No Negative Everything was awesome especially the lovley staff,1
 Balcony should have some chairs Good location,1
 The reception staff was not very helpfull Whenever i asked something the word No seems easier than to actually find out about the enquiry There were no umbrellas to borrow which i find shocking for a hotel in a country where it rains so often  Salim the concierge luggage carrrier all rounder should be a manager He knows how to assist customers Always friendly and very helpfull ,0

"This was a horrible hotel. Went to check in and the front office smelled horrible. The parking spots are so tiny. The elevator didn't work. When opening the door to the room, it sounded like one of the hinges wasn't attached. The room was EXTREMELY small. No where to sit, no where to put your luggage. No space for anything really. The window was open so when I closed it, I don't think there was a lock on it. You could hear everything outside and the people walking around above. The room smelled very musky (maybe that's why the window was open). 
Went back to the office to say we weren't staying. We didn't get our money back or anything. They said it was a non refundable room. Their website does not list any reservation restrictions. I was staying for - days, I wasn't going to stay!!!!!",0
"Really enjoyed the Mayfair - staff friendly and helpful, rooms clean and commodious. Convenient to subway and short walk to theatres and restaurants. Tremendous value. Was slightly disappointed that the bistro was being rennovated, though. I know where to stay in Midtown now!",0
 We re meant to push beds together and I left room quickly after checkin to allow this to happen and when I returned hadn t been done Walls are very thin could hear some one turning on light switches plugging in chargers whole conversations tv etc not a great nights sleep  Location was good Quiet neighbourhood ,0
 The lifts are always out of order Plus they now take a 50 deposit to cover extra They never did this before  Location,0
 room and bathroom were a bit oldish friendly and helpful staff rich breakfast bufet and the location are an asset,1
 Although we had required in our booking a double bed initially two single separated beds were given to us The receptionist was not accepting that this is a mistake of the hotel since double bed is a preference and not a requirement I did not like that I had to argue a lot before we finally get what we wanted  Personel was kind and helpful on providing information about the city and attractions ,0

 I usually stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel whenever I m in town for my business meetings The only reason I chose the Park International was because there weren t any rooms available at the Chelsea There is a very rude staff member by the name of Mia who made my check in a complete nightmare she tried to bully me into going to another hotel down the road that I believe they have affiliations with When I insisted on checking in it s one night only she sent me to the basement I had a massive argument with her and the manager who handled the situation perfectly I must say this girl Mia has zero hospitality skills and is definitely in the wrong business  The prices were adequate for the location ,0

 When the second room was ready the other two in our party checked in even though it wasn t the right room The executive room with whirlpool and sitting area turned out to be a family room with some bunk beds in the corner Very disappointing  Super nice woman at check in nice guy at check ou Only one room was ready so we took that one and off we went to explore Loved the location ,1
 The steps at the front entrance made it difficult for my girlfriend who uses a wheelchair however the door staff were 100 wonderful and made it as easy as possible I understand that it s a listed building and not something that can be changed  Beautiful building with heaps of history We were very lucky to get a room on the top floor on a corner overlooking Russell Square I am a sucker for a good view The location was by far the best part it was fantastic to be so near to everything My first trip to London where I barely got the Underground anywhere ,1
 When checking out receptionist tried to charge us an extra 90 euros on top of 615 euros already paid through booking com for 3 nights room only Told it was tax but spoke to manager eventually and owed 29 euro tax I was under the impression that the tax had already been added on by booking com Not happy  Good location comfortable room property easy to get to using public transport from the airport,0
"The French Quarters Guest Apartments is perfectly located just a couple blocks from Times Square on Restaurant Row. Our suite was beautifully decorated and furnished, the beds and linens were luxurious, and the balcony was lovely. We were warmly welcomed and felt at home from the moment we walked in the door.

We discovered and enjoyed tremendously our new favorite restaurant just across the street - Becco. The French Quarters Guest Apartments is our new New York home!",1

 We gave stayed at the Hampshire before and had a lovely stay we have always booked the suite but on this occasion we had a terrible time with the people in the next room on the first night we had to call the night porter 5 times between 2 00am and 5 30am due to the noise coming from the room next door continually banging doors and partying with another couple then the party progressed to the couples arguing and fighting the night porters tried to quieten them down without success I just felt that the management could have done a bit more on the next night to help us The staff at the hotel was lovely and in a great location,0
No Negative Thr room and hotel decor was tired and a bit scruffy the room had a kitchen area no sink but the fridge didn t close and it clearly wasn t for use The bathroom was old fashioned byt clean and usable the bed was very comfortable windows in the room didn t open so as it was v hot we had to use the air con which was fine but the room did smell musty or perhaps a previous guest had smoked in the room Overall it was ok but we have stayed at other hotels in the area with similar facilities and felt more comfortable,0
 Service was appalling throughout the stay Poor bar service ignored yet overstaffed breakfast service was chaotic and housekeeping asked us to leave an hour before checkout twice  Decent location and hotel in good condition,0
"When hotels were privately, rather than corporately held, the situation at the Sir Francis Drake would never have been allowed to happen. This was once a top-tier hotel which has been allowed to slip a rung where only the guests take notice. The lobby is still opulently appointed, the dress and service provided by desk personnel is flawless, the Beefeaters at the entrance provide the superficial """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""touch of class"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Alas, the attention to detail doesn't carry through, once you leave the elevator. Doors and jams with chipped paint, bathroom showers with pitted porcelain, and ice machines with distressingly long-term notices indicating breakdown. To be sure, the maids and bellhops do a commendable job, but regrettably, the Drake definitely isn't what it once was.",0

 Nothing really  Surprisingly good We were not expecting much of the hotel when we saw it was a tall building in the edge of a residential area The hotel has three floors the top floors of the building Room was very big and offered some drinks in the minibar At recepetion you could have tea coffee and water for free any time Breakfast was very nice all you can ask for I totally recommend you have breakfast here because of the quality and secondly in the area there is not much around Tram into centre of Amsterdam is direct and takes around 20 min That is brilliant ,1

 Minor thing the breakfast buffet was too high Even thought the presentation was beautiful you could not reach for the food  The loft room was an upgrade so we were very excited It felt like an appartment Beautiful lux decor contemporary furnishings and exquisite photo wall paper Devine bathroom Service of staff was amazing friendly and well versed on all things PARI ,1
 Cold air blows all the time Staff we re unhelpful obstructive and rude refusing to even try and solve Finally one friendly ambassador did volunteer to solve He did it hero to the customer was castigated by his colleagues Everything in room controlled by ipad Supposedly It didn t work No one could get it to work Bed so uncomfortable I am still suffering with my back even after 3 nights at home I will avoid this hotel in future and recommend everyone else does too Great shame it could be such a great hotel  Decor is good View is great ,0

 The reception was possibly the worst I have encountered not only because is was in a cubby hole but it was the least welcoming It was all about taking the money There was no smile no welcome and no explanation for example of breakfast or how to use the life For your information you need to use your key card in there in case they don t tell you First impressions are so important and for that reason it had a big impact on the stay  The breakfast was querky with a south American twist I think I actually quite liked it The room was clean and OK ,0

 The bed that was supposed to be kingside was infact two single beds pushed together Also the room was very small so you couldn t move around much without tripping over things We picked the excecuative room so thought we d have more space but didn t Also the shower was leaking in the bathroom so water kept going everywhere Breakfast was also misleading although it states continental breakfast in with the price for 10 it s actually cheaper not to pre buy breakfast and have a full English for around 5 7 pounds which they don t tell you The cleaning staff seemed a little abrupt with people which was disappointing and the waitresses at breakfast time  The reception staff were lovely and friendly ,1

 If you need a reminder that the old saying you get what you pay for is usually untrue may I present Novotel It was not my first choice but I hoped the rather steep price would be offset by a spacious room with all the expected facilities The room was not small but still cramped Facilities a letdown Tiny insubstantial coffee cups and a TV with no programme guide i e for some reason it was one of the functions channels they d blocked Who really cares about a mini bar an in house laundry service or an ipad dock when you have a dodgy tv dodgy tea service and a strange two part ensuite arrangement shower and bath in a large screened off area toilet in a wardrobe size compartment which is almost in plain view of the person entering the room  I liked the location,0

On our return trip, we will stay here again:)",1

 Air conditioning There was none Exceptionally hot weather meant windows had to be left open in my 1st floor room and traffic noise kept me awake Other rooms may have a c and higher floors may be less noisy My original courtyard room was stifingly hot and I had to move to a road side room more air but traffic noise Staff very helpful with room move View from 1st floor Courtyard room disappointing see pic I was expecting something a bit more rustic  Free wi fi great breakfast friendly and helpful staff Good range of TV channels in English Nice restaurant able to sit outside Reasonably easy to get to from airport by public transport train to Vienna Hbf and one stop on U bahn or walk ,1
 On check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue The chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when I said we will cancel and I would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay This ruined our start to our stay Marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom Carpet small bedroom also  Great location fantastic breakfast of very high quality foods Theatre bar and original features are impressive ,0

Now the rest--my room was filthy. Even after the cleaning person finished there were lint, paper, and piled up dust in every corner. The bathroom and dressing area had what looked like chunks of dirt on the floor. There were hairballs in the bathtub leftover from a previous customer.
Only one electrical outlet and one light were working. 
The bed mattresses were old and soggy.
There was a musty, wet-socks smell that permeated the room.
Get the picture?
It was a pre-paid Hotwire booking, so I was stuck with my choice.",0
 The staff could have been a bit friendlier the bed wasn t that comfortable and parts of the room looked a bit tired and in need of fixing telephone wire broken mould round the bath broken blind etc  Modern hotel loved the rooftop pool and cleaners did a great job of the room everyday 5 minute walk to the Metro and tram which was extremely easy to use and navigate Overall very good value for money really enjoyed our time in Barcelona ,1

 We stayed for 5 nights but were given the smallest room on the floor walking around the furniture could only be done one person at a time Also we had to pay extra for wifi in our room and even more for high speed wifi despite it being available all over the city for free I think the hotel scrambles the signal in the hotel so you can t get free wifi unless you sit in the lobby  The hotel was central and easy to walk to from the train station and all the tourist services hop on hop off buses and cruises etc ,0
 Older hotel Breakfast,0
 The room was grim London tiny and desperate for a refurb with black grout around the tub and hairs that were definitely not ours And a view of a window well of 3 brick walls And the irony is that reception upgraded us what was our original room like  The reception was excellent staff went out of their way to welcome us ,0

"This is classed as an hotel but more like a motel, did not feel safe at night, people hanging around outside your rooms, doorlocks broken for entry to parts of the building. Barricaded myself in with s-cases chairs etc. Lesson to be learnt sorry but never again.",0
"We just returned from a week long stay at the Renaissance Times Square and enjoyed every minute. The room was spacious and very clean, as was the bathroom. My wife loved the deep tub and enjoyed a relaxing bath every night. Room service was delicious and affordable (try the breaded chicken and shrimp for a scrumtious late night snack). The service was impeccable. The view of Times Square from the bar & resturaunt is all that it's hyped up to be. If you're looking to be right in the middle of Times Square, your wish will be granted. One step out the door of the hotel and your knee deep in the midst of it all. If we decide to stay in Times Square again we will not hesitate to stay at the Renaissance again. Enjoy!",1

 Unfortunately the hotel were very inflexible My friends mother had to have an emergency operation which effected our plans due to childcare this preventing our stay The hotel refused to move the date of our booking or waver the cancellation fee It was bank holiday Sunday and all rooms were fully booked I am more than certain this room could have been resold Very disappointing No Positive,0

 Breakfast bed pillows The Stake Dinner,0
 Cleaning wasn t brilliant somebody had left a sock under the bed and it was still there and very dusty which is an indicator No food available apart from outsourced room service we arrived quite late so this was a bit of a problem  Free bottled water efficient check in and check out Good location but a very quiet area in the morning so you could easily get there from further afield before anything got going Leadenhall Market almost opposite is nice ,0
"Stayed there for two nights and the location is excellent. The front desk person """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SEAN"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" forgot that his job was for customer service and never smiled. When leaving, asked or a taxi, and was informed that he called for a cab, despite me not seeing him calling a cab and waited for -- minutes. When we stood in front of him and asked him to call a cab while we waited, to which he did, the cab came in less than - minutes. 
Paid the full amount in cash and came back and found out that my credit card was still charged on the basic amount, despite me fully informing that my card should not be charged. My money is still not returned. Shame on you Best Western for such bad service.",0
 Shower wasn t the best no power  Location is great for Regent s park literally 2 minute walk Hotel is 200 yards from Great Portland street tube station use warren street for tube into the centre of London takes about 5 minutes walk to get there then 10 minutes on the tube to Leicester Square Plenty of convenience stores and pubs to have a drink around the hotel 10 minute walk down Portland Street and you are in Oxford street ,0

 Without prejudice the service located at concierge has some work to do Breakfast buffet gardens and location also the good service provided at breakfast consistently at each and every morning,0
 unfriendly staff dirty rooms rude treatment trying to make more money than 300 Euros that I paid for a half single bed per night knocking my door every morning 9 am to make the room and wake me up knowing at my door in the middle of the night saying im smoking when I ddnt even have cigarettes with me Noise all day since early morning from construction restoration of their restaurantNo Positive,0
 The Booking com price guarantee is a joke Price of the property dropped 60 per day and included breakfast we haven t received a dime and the hotel refused to honor the free breakfast on the booking com website  Nice modern hotel near the train station and Red Light District ,0

 Carpet flooring is old and smelly  Location just a few meters away from the main station the dam and the red light district is perfect The concierge can give you some tips on the what and where,1
 The ridiculously small room and the lack of personal attention at check in The concept is probably popular with Americans who like the Starbucks McDonalds style of service but it seems really tacky in London  Location,0
 we were first given a dark smelly and extremely small smoking room After asking for what we had booked we got a much bigger family room with huge windows but movng around was still difficult due to 4 beds in the room  location ist great a lot can be reached by foot if not metro station is right at the corner friendly staff and breakfast all right,0

 Pool could be warmer Lovely size room lovely pianist playing in Gordon s bar nice touch really felt the ambiance,1
If you have children don't stay here! This place is a jail. Children have no where to play they can make no noise what so ever and the management is horriable. I have seen people who work here take their animals out to the bathroom and not clean up. Our room smells so bad from the carpets. The couch is horriable and broken down. And to pay as much as we do is a horriable thing. Some people do not have a choice but to come to a place like this but no matter why you do you should never be treated like you are a prisoner!,0

 11 for a pretty poor breakfast Missing the toilet brush Bidet blocked I had to signal it to the reception Location close to Sagrada Familia and to metro station Comfortable bed Very polite staff,0
 The first day of curtains can not be closed the bathtub does not have a bathtub plug and hit the phone twice the hotel did not send someone to solve until the next day all resolved  Hotel location is good next to the Milan Cathedral,1
 They charged 65 euros for a tiny load od laundry They even did not say it will cost money until check out  Smells great,1
 There was nothing good about this hotel staff at reception was had no smile on face very rude room allotted to us was badly smelling lift was not working breakfast was very poor quality so as restaurant staff very rude and unpleasant faces over all very bad experience staying in this hotel never recommend any one to stay in this hotel nothing was good at all except of location ,0
 Not enough toiletries supplied  Bed was comfortable and room had a lovely view ,1
 The food in jenny s restaurant was not at its best as I m sure constantly cooking the same food over an over must affect a chefs passion over time im not sure but the hotel had several restaurants to chose from so wasn t all bad  Everything was amazing but the only negative comment I could possibly have was that the food was not what I guess I expected wasn t what I expected when told it was a carvery but many other choices to pick from Other than that it s the best hotel I ve ever stayed at and my sons 16th birthday treat was amazing and he simply thought the hotel was a palace xx,1
 Shower Small bed 4 6 double Noise from window Room next to lift Chipped sink Stained sink bar area Staff Location,0
 Staff some doesnt speak any English And during my many visits I have felt being ignored not on purpose i hope i e no one came to take my order in the restaurant for a good 20minutes before i had to excuse them Drink menu being snatched away n only given back after confirming i was a guest Cant find info about my loyalty card on the system  Very quiet and room is at right temperature and moisture for a good night sleep ,1
 They gave me free bottle of water However there was a day that the bottle of water was already open which I m glad I noticed  Location is good as it is beside the Victoria train station and accessible to key tourist spots shops and restaurants Bed is very comfy TV is of good size Wifi is also pretty fast ,0

"The good: nicely located, cool views, decent parking, relatively clean.
The bad: waaaay outdated, bathroom so small you can't close the door without standing on the toilet, broken ac, person who came to try to fix the ac did not speak English and brought us a fan instead, restaurant closed over an hour early because """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""they didn't want extra labor"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", when we asked for wine glasses they told us to go get our own.
Overall: if you don't expect much it's ok...but if you expect the three stars they advertise themselves as then move on.",0

 Shocking service at the desk very rude member of staff Initially put in a twin room both single beds The room had an overpowering bad smell Damp all in the bathroom ceiling and tiles Complained and asked to be moved and had to upgrade to be able to get a room that didn t smell Not what I expects from this brand Hilton  Location Iron ,0
"I stayed here on March -th and they missed my wake-up call. Luckily, I woke up on my own in time for my conference. When addressing the issue, the front desk staff were helpful, promising a comp and apologizing for the mishap. Then, the GM emerges (Ana), and insists that their records showed an answered call, and as a result, could offer NO comps, not even priority club points. She basically called me, someone who's stayed at this property many times and was here on business, a liar, and took the word of a computer over mine. I found this distasteful and in the worst traditions of the hospitality industry. I will not be staying here again.",0
 breakfast expensiveNo Positive,1
 I paid prior to arrival through my father s visa card When I arrived they told me I need to get authorizarion from my father meanwhile they will just do a preauthorization on the card I had with me On the next day my father sent the letter they said they released the hold on the card I had Almost a month after still the amount is not released My bank told me that they charged the full amount on both cards For some reason the staff are not very smart to understand it are now claiming I stayed double the number of nights The lovely thing is that room seevice woke me up at 8 00am that day to check out and now they claim I did not check out Worst hotel experience in my life No Positive,0
 as we checked in on 18 July 16 and we find the a c of the room not working properly and we asked the hotel to change the room but they say there is no more twin bed room but it s showing in booking com And no wifi in the room we have to go in the lobby to connect to the wifi Also there is no safe box in the room too so how come the rating of this hotel is 4 star  Location only,0

 Breakfasts not as good as they used to be but the dining room is a great experience  excellent welcome comfortable room in a Georgian town house good facilities and very handy for King s Cross,1
 Only one lift working for three days Not good enough  Convenient for the tube and shopping ,0
 Our room had a really strong smokey odor I think because of the guests before us lt wasn t nice to sleep in as non smokers Location price quality we booked a regular room but got a superior room instead we found out only later very kind and helpfull staff ,1
 Lobby is designed wrong to many people at once in and out at the same time and lack of traffic flow the different levels are a problem as well Specially for luckage overall not comfortable to enter in a hotel of 5 stars  Comfortable rooms spacious good bathroom reasonably quiet for center city,1
 The online picture leads one to believe that the room booked will be much bigger a better room guide is neededNo Positive,0
 The room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around London Hotel is lovely very clean and everything you need hairdryer supplied and no need to bring my owe as if very long hair some hotel hairdryers are shocking Central to the tubes and busses and staff very helpful when look for directions ,0

"Another visit to this location. Stayed for one night on arrival , then another night just before departure from Phoenix. On both occasions was greeted by notice informing me that the repeptionist was dealing with another customer elsewhere, gone for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""- minutes"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Could be a coincidence, but the - minutes turned into -- minutes on the second arrival. Not impressed....especially after a long flight-journey.
From a security point of view, it was disconcerting to find the side (exit) door propped open with a box on both occasions...thereby allowing open access to anyone passing by. This needs to be monitored regularly.....perhaps during those '- minutes' spent away from the reception desk.
However, the rooms were are up to the usual good standard, and the recent refurbishment providing a comfortable nights stay in a clean room with all the facilities you would expect for slef-catering.",0
 Cleanliness My bedsheets and pillows had makeup stains and the cleaners left it like that and said they only changed Beddings every 3 days was really upset when I got back to the hotel at night to discover this They didn t even make the bed they just covered it with the duvet Called the lobby no one answered went down to the reception no one was there had to wait 25mins before she came back me said she is the only one running 2 hotels at the same time because they had another hotel across the road Also rooms are too small like a bed and breakfast  Bad bad bad,0
 we have to pay extra because one of the rooms was not in the same buidling as the otehrs and they blame it on booking so this was my last time by booking  the kindness of the guest relations manager,0
 Staff gave me a key to an occupied room Then they misspelled my name and then they gave me a key that didn t work Breakfast is super expensive and not worthy at all  Location and View,0

No Negative The staff were all excellent very helpful and considerate Couldn t praise them enough ,1
 The room was 8 m2 Website pictures were done somewhere else for sure No Positive,0
 Our mistake we booked a small room and it was really small We had also indicated that we preferred a view but didn t demand one so we got no view at all This is probably a very nice classic hotel if you book the right room but 230 per night for a tiny room with no view is not a good deal No Positive,0
 Even after asking twice our cups spoons glasses and shower gel were not changed cleaned over the 4 days we were there Our room was situated right next to the staff door on the 2nd floor which kept banging shut from 11pm to 9am every day We did mention this and were told it would not happen again but got worse When we checked out after 4 nights no one asked how our stay was  The shower was nice and hot with plenty of room in the bathroom Curtains were excellent in keeping the light out in the morning ,0
 Smell in bathroom noisy air conditioner  Good breakfast clean room quiet location but far from downtown you need car or to use subway Relative pleasant staff ,0
No Negative Everything was very clean excellent service and staff ,1

 Room not available on arrival damaged tiling in the bathroom and dirty carpets No Positive,0
 One of the reception staff a male was always very short and impatient i called reception and he put the phone down on me when i had not finished my conversation and it was about the blocked toilet The bell boy who came up to look was very helpful and friendly even though nothing was sorted as all that was needed was a plunger and cant believe the whole hotel did not have one In the end i used a coat hanger to plunged it and it was done The pool was a joke so small and over crowded the pictures was deceiving very intimidating especially when you bring young children to swim and it is full of adults Checking out was unfriendly too  the room was comfy enough space for a small family room was cleaned and always clean towels,0
 worst beds in over 7 hotels slept in on this trip poor design of room location we had to use the service lift One front desk girl was very helpful,0
 I did not like the fact that that the bathroom and toilet were separate Mattress was also very farm and would have preferred medium At the end the manager managed to fix something but still the problem was there and i did not sleep well  Location was quite central I was expecting more from Novatel hotel despite been rated 4 star ,0
Location near Union Square is great and it has an interesting but quirky decorating scheme - the opposite of neutral beiges. But the other amenities were barely adequate: the towels were rough and nearly thread bare; the complimentary wine in the lobby between --- was jug quality; the in-house bistro was barely adequate (several orders had to be sent back) and expensive. Would not stay here again.,0
 Nothing  The hotel was lovely clean welcoming and well set out The rooms and hotel location were perfect I will definitely be returning here ,1
 some parts door of elevator radiators in the bathroom needs be paintedNo Positive,1

 Although it seems luxurious it is a bit old Bathrooms would need a renovation For example in bathroom one can see a bit of mould in the shower Not to mention that while we were in room someone from the staff entered to see it without knocking she just unlocked The rooms differ from photos but ok  very comfortable bed nice breakfrast very close to metro,0
 Ww where not listed from Booking com under our complete name they couldnt find us in the beginning Old interior and need to be refreshed for this value of money Cold atmospher expected more No Positive,0
 unfortunately our first impression of this hotel was a good one but as we got into our room things just did not have the same impression on us the bathroom was really not to a standard at all blinds dirty window with old plants bath panel not finished ceiling dirty generally not a good impression at all we did ask for new light bulb and panel to be sorted and they did try but the overall experience of the bathroom was not good at all  The entrance size of bedroom breakfast good,0
 more variety I have stayed in better 4 star hotels breakfast was always rushed and sometimes are not available at times,0
 Main road location and had a view of an office and the nets didn t close fully so had to drawer curtains for privacy but this was so minor compared to the benefits We also only has two towels and one little bottle of shower gel for four people Large sized family room very comfy pillows and huge beds Great choice for breakfast and easy access to theatre land The pool was loved too and the choice of shops bars and restaurants in the hotel ,1
 My upgrade to a bigger room had 3 single portable beds all with remarkably uncomfortable mattresses Breakfast was appalling the cheapest of ingredients and served tepid Staff in bar rudely challenged me carrying 2 pints 10 yards from the counter to my table until I produced my room ID never experienced anything like it  Location good Spacious bar with nice view ,0
 we were in a room on the third floor overlooking the strand although the window was double glazed and there was was a wooden shutter there was still a lot of noise but not as bad as the room next door the walls must be paper thin the next room switched there tv on at 7 30 am we could here every word and it woke us up  location ideal if visiting the west end theater land just a 5 minute walk away the inhouse carvery restaurant is fabulous one of the best carverys i have ever had ,1

 Room didn t have a fridge which I d find really useful and I found the bike saddle very hard and uncomfortable  I ve stayed in a number of hotels in and around Amsterdam and this is as good as any better than many The hotel has a youthful vibe with the mix of guests The staff are very friendly and helpful good sized room comfortable bed nice en suite The Pool restaurant has good service and some incredible food There are also a variety of restaurants nearby along the river Bike rental is relatively cheap with great underground secure bike storage and the metro stop is literally outside the front door ,1
 I requested to pay on arrival but money had cleared from my bank account a day before arriving The room we were first given was very dingy and standard felt as if we could have got a lot better room with Travelodge or premier inn  they changed our room when we requested and the staff were very helpful,1

 I would like to have eaten breakfast in the former booking office but it was rather too expensive I thought  Such a nostalgic stay in this hotel where one can have tea where the taxis used pick up passengers in the past I took a fascinating guided tour into the wonderfully restored areas which were part of the original hotel ,1
 Nothing All good  You very kindly upgraded us to a suite as it was my husbands birthday ,1
 We didn t have a window to open our room was looking into the bar So felt we had to close our curtains as we felt people were looking up wen the light was on definitely would of loved a room with a view and window for some fresh air  Hotel was lovely Although we just had booked room only which was very small ,1

"Checked out of the Ramada and then came back later that evening after deciding to stay another night. They asked if we wanted the same room, SURE! Anyway on going into our room I immediately noticed that they did not change the sheets, my red hair was on the pillowcase. Then on closer inspection it looked like they had not changed the sheets for a very long time, dust in the corners and pubic hair from different people. I was ill. When complaining the clerk was shocked but nothing was done and management was not to be found. Lucky there were no bed bugs. Disgusting, and now I inspect closely and bring my own bedding to hotels.",0

 The hotel is tired and in need of investment  The location of this hotel is excellent It is walking distance from two Underground stations and very close to both Hyde Park and Green Park if you are looking to enjoy London s parks The team are friendly and helpful ,0
"If you are staying in D.C. on business, this is a nice hotel. The best part is the hotel's location. When you enter, you walk into huge lobby with very high ceilings. The elevators use a system I haven't seen before-- you scan your room key and are told which elevator to wait for. I thought it was confusing. The rooms are a little small, but not too bad. Shower, toilet, and sink are all located inside the bathroom, so it can be a challenge getting showered, dressed, etc if sharing the room (I like it when sinks are right outside the bathroom door.) There is an additional charge for internet access, which is annoying. Room service was not quick, but tasted good. Fitness center was large, with ample machines. I felt comfortable here, but not pampered.",0

 Arrived at 220pm and only one room was ready I had to wait over 2 hours until my room was ready The only thing staff could say was they had to many late check outs I don t see this as a good reason Area and room was ok,0
 Big canal bridge rail construction project immediately in front of the hotel is very inconvenient Hard to cross the street it is muddy when it rains a bit noisy Small room  Beautiful hotel with history Written up in DK travel book as a sight Affordable luxury although the good price might be due to the construction Pretty close to the museums and near many restaurants ,1

"Was in Charlotte for a weekend with friends and wanted to stay downtown. I've stayed at the Ritz in Charlotte previously and had a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, the Ritz was ful, so we stayed at the Dunhill. Basically, it's fine, but here's nothing memorable or that would make me return. It's shabby in a way that begs to be redone -- carpet worm through, chairs in the very small lobby become threadbare, grout flaking off in the bathroom. Would not stay here again.",0

I will warn you, some people in my group didn't see it that way. They saw it as an old hotel, with new sheets on the bed. I disagree. The service was great, it is located in a good area, and it is only a $- cab ride to anywhere. Cab from airport should be around $-- w- tip.",1

Our non-smoking room reeked of cigarette smoke but when we opened the windows wide to let in some air the traffic noise was too great to enable a desperately needed sleep after --+ hours of travelling. We finally fell asleep around -am and woke up only -- mins before the shuttle bus was scheduled to take us back to the airport and the reception staff were not prepared to change the time of our transfer. So great start to our holiday in the USA.,0

"I chose the hotel because it was very close to someone that I was visiting. From day one the lavatory sink drain was clogged and the water just laid in the sink until I left, also the counter around the sink was very small and water just laid on the counter which made it dangerous to use the coffee maker. IMPORTANT-They didn't have a microwave or a refrigerator for use in the room. They had a restaurant in the hotel that I guess they wanted you to eat at although it was expensive. Fortunately there was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jack-In-A-Box"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" next door where I could get a cup of coffee and something to eat at a reasonable price.",0

No complimentary Wi-Fi in the lobby. Breakfast very expensive ($--+ for american breakfast after gratuity, service charges, etc...) Bathroom was also very small. Parking is overpriced at $-- (including tax). Seems they charge around $-- for others (airport parking), how can they justify charging guests more? Also check-in line was slow, they could have used more staff. The check in clerk was friendly.
Unfortunate about the noise as we could overlook other things. Getting a good nights sleep is important when you have an early flight the next morning.",0

 The rooms were a little tired and the bathroom tiny with a poor shower The 4 stars were just about deserved compared to the Holiday Inn at Stratford which was so much better Air con and heating also a bit poor Ask for a room on the upper floors the view from the 16th floor was amazing This hotel was OK but it s time for a refurbishment  Lovely huge reception bar and cafe area plus restaurant Nice lounge area Very fast lifts and great views from the upper floors ,0
 Service breakfast the basic lights in the room do not work and we replaced them by our mobile you cannot see well outside of the Windows Good design of the room,0
 Non complimentary wi fi  Staff was pleasant and polite ,1
 The room is SUPER TINY as compared to all neighborhood hotels whereby even offer cheaper price The breakfast has the SAME menu every single day throughout our 7 days stay The Housekeeper s cleaniliness quality is poor The Bathroom is so small yet the chair is freaking heavy to move around that tiny area There is no bottle opener for guest to enjoy our own purchased wine nor beer guest has to bring the bottle down to open worse facility than 1 star hotel  Free wifi location is great,0
 Mattresses need to be changed Some people from reception seem to make fun faces of guests ascents what s irritating Room could be cleaned up better  Serena the girl who help people out in the restaurant during breakfast time She s the best Always smiling patient and receptive with everyone who needs her ,0
 service at reception not always with a smile Great facilities in room expresso excellent bathroom comfy bed,1
 The staff One in particular on reception Very rude from the moment we tried checking in to which she rudely and abruptly told us there was no reservation in our names even though I had the confirmation with me right up until check out when she lost one of our credit cards then proceeded to tell us it wasn t her fault Wouldn t stay here again on this basis  The location was fantastic Rooms very nice ,0

"I booked the Helix for a one night stay on cyber Monday, so got a very good rate. The front desk staff were nice, and the location is good for restaurants-nightlife, although not very good for access to the Metro. My room was really beginning to show its age. Stains on the couch and counter tops, and the shower head was not properly attached and spilled water everywhere. I could tell that it had been 'fixed' several times (signs of caulk and tape, etc). The decor is also dated. Weird sheer curtains around the bed and window were kind of in the way and not very attractive. There was hardly any space on the night stands to even put a cell phone, much less a book or glass of water. Overall my experience was ok given the rate I paid, but I probably wouldn't stay here again.",0
 Didn t tell us about fire alarm test Tv guide didn t work properly Didn t put any sugar in the room when they got it ready Asked on our way out for some to be taken to room for our return When we came back they still hadn t put any sugar in the room So another trip to reception to have some bought up to room  It was clean Staff was friendly Location was ideal Elegant decore ,1
 Found hair in my bath that was quite clearly not mine Bath should have been cleaned properly Wardrobe doors were precarious to say the least so I did not use it for fear of them falling out of the frame D cor was out dated and tied lots of road noise from the street below and I was on the 10th floor  Can t think of anything oh yes the beer was reasonably priced ,0
 The room was small and the bed pushed up against the wall meaning I had to climb over my partner to get out  Staff were lovely and helpful the location was good for everything we wanted to do The food in the restaurant was very good ,0
 No lift breakfast served in another hotel Receptionist no smile nor warmth  Location and comfort,0

 The area isn t great but we chose it for ease to get to Wembley Thought it was Priced a little high  Size of eventual room cleanliness of it Breakfast was good Staff were polite including those in the pub Although room was non refundable the hotel gave us the opportunity of re scheduling our stay as we were staying there for the Adele concert that was cancelled I thought this was a nice gesture although we decided to still go n the date booked due to train tickets ,0
"Staying at the Metro was a highlight of my recent five-night trip to New York. I was there during an unusual spring snowstorm. However, the location of the Metro was perfect. It was near the Empire State Building and within walking distance of the theater district. The hotel had a wonderful breakfast every morning, which kept overall expenses low. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor. My room was larger than I expected with a roomy closet. It was very clean and quiet. I look forward to going back.",1

 The beds consisted of 2 mattresses which were too soft The pillows were also too thick for your head to be at a comfortable height  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with any request eg taxi booking and online takeaway services as the hotel doesn t have room service Whilst the breakfast area looked small there was a good and tasty variety Convenient to get to the Centraal Station tram 26 was very frequent and only a few minutes walk away ,1

 Room s furnishings poor beds very uncomfortable noise isolation poor the entire night we could hear the tossing and turning of the guests above us  The receptions attitude regarding type of card payment was sarcastic borderline offensive Otherwise they were polite and prompt on ordering the taxi ,0
 There are two big avenues in front of the hotel and one can hear the cars even in the night It is not very loud but if you are used to complete silence to fall asleep it could be a little unpleasant  Very nice place We enjoyed the gym and the spa jacuzzi and sauna a lot after having walked for hours in Barcelona It is not very close to the center but in the end it was even better less crowded calmer The Poblenou Rambla is very close and it is better than the Rambla in the center at least you can have a walk without slaloming among people We tried the hotel restaurant once and it was quite good and not too expensive People are nice the bedrooms are comfortable clean and well equipped We are happy about our holidays ,1
 Staff were not very friendly nor accommodating The spa area was really small needs a upgrade Jacuzzi cold water steam Room was Shut and not working for the two days pool area needs cleaning  Location,0

 There was a bad odour of stale mops or water at the top of the stairs when we turned the corner to walk along the corridor to our room Possibly coming from a storage cupboard for cleaning supplies  The bed was so comfortable and the view from our room took in the front view of the Hotel So central to the whole of Greenwich village Such a delightful setting with wonderful attractions literally minutes walk away We will be back ,1
 Restaurant staff seem untrained and unsure of what their duties are We had several problems at dinner We were not offered a la carte and so were forced to have the buffet The table next to us were given menus Not asked if we would like anything to drink we had to ask someone Desert wine brought to us instead of port And a few other things At check out we were charged for 4 breakfasts and were made to feel as though we were not being honest despite explaining that there were in fact only two of us and we had only stayed for one night A few other things but due to inexperienced staff I feel  Room and facilities very comfortable,0

"The location is located in the theater district of Boston. Subway station is --minute walk away. Chinatown is --minute walk away.
Services at front desk is average at best. Be aware that if you stay at the lower levels, you will hear the noise and bass coming from the clubs downstairs and nearby. It is kind of annoying. Also, the wall is so thin that you can hear people talking next room clearly.
The only good thing of this hotel is its location only.",0

 Communication between reception and housekeeping staff was imperfect and both I and the friends with whom we were travelling were repeatedly interrupted when the Do not Disturb sign was lit Because the hotel was spread across 5 different interconnected buildings rooms at the same price level offered markedly different facilities Breakfast was good but very expensive  Reception staff were very helpful when we checked in early because I was unwell and the concierge service was excellent Room was perfectly comfortable and there were excellent facilities in the lobby area Location excellent The Grand Cafe Krasnapolsky was a very pleasant cafe and dining location ,1
 Drainage after shower is a bit slow have to slow the water flow to avoid flooding in the bathroom beacuse there is no barrier to stop water in the shower tub But we still enjoy the stay here  Excellent location large room ,1

 Our room was a little tired so perhaps it needs smartening up  Central location,0
"We stayed in this hotel - nights in May ----.
The location of the hotel is great - everything in Midtown & Central Park is in short walk. 
The hotel seems to be very old and definatly needs a renovation. 
Rooms are spacious but furniture is old and shabby. The bed is also old and not comfortable. The bathroom was at the same level. The view from the window was to the inner yard - means the view of the wall in front. . 
The breakfast was only available by room service. 
The advantage was the price we paid - was much less than other hotels nearby. 
Also we'd like to pay tribute to the staff - they tried to thier best in those circumstances. We changed room twice before find an acceptable one and received a complimentary drink. 
Next time we'll choose another hotel.",0

 Despite allowing dogs this is not a particularly pet friendly hotel making you sign a somewhat restrictive waiver room allocated was in a very busy and noisy part of the property which is disrupting for animals staff will accommodate a change if you ask room was small and furnishings not clean stained chair and marked carpet expensive by comparison lifts were ridiculously busy and unpleasant at peak hours no close toileting spot for animals lit light switch on the wall is VERY bright at night  Staff are lovely and check in was super and welcoming Location is very central ,0
 The hotel is relatively expensive food available it is a bit of a limited menu  Location is very convenient Hotel is of a good standard rooms are very nice ,1
 The room was so small The bed was at best a large single bed Would not call it a double bed Not much room for a couple Bathroom was tiny no room in the shower and certainly not enough room to dry yourself The room was also small not much room for 2 people to move around There was a loud annoying noise coming from outside the room which might have been some air conditioning units but when we called to complain about this the noise stopped but then started again 10 minutes later and continued on and off throughout the night Not sure why there was a window in the room when all there was to look at was the peoples room opposite and some brick walls  Location was OK ,0
 Cleaning was good but made small mistakes Staff very friendly great location very comfortable room,1
 It s 2 hours to chk in and 4 changing rooms and I was upgrade and downgrade the staff is poor knowledge of the rooms I reqst twin bed and ithey move us 4 times its was bad poor service my guest bag was stolen and it s was totally a bad experience not recommended at all No Positive,0
 all ok everything,1
 It was very noisy at the property Workmen were doing drilling and renovations right outside the breakfast room The sound made us leave rather than enjoy the breakfast offerings because it was so loud The hotel really should have asked the workmen to begin work in that particular area after breakfast service I understand that renovations need to be undertaken but more care should be taken in relation to guest comfort It was disappointing that nothing was listed on the booking com website or the Hilton website itself about the renovations taking place  The bed was comfortable and the room clean The wifi was strong and all of the staff members were lovely and welcoming The location being so close to Euston Station was absolutely brilliant ,0

"I stayed here for a week. The hotel is nice, it's very smart and has been recently renovated. Negatives: The fire alarm went off three times during my stay. Although I was told to stay put by the speak system, it was a bit unsettling. Housekeeping seemed to want to clean my room at -.--am which I found a tad early - not that I wanted to lie-in all morning in such a wonderful city, I just felt pressured to get out of the room. The internet is ridiculously expensive. Most hotels have complimentary WIFI now. $-- a day is too much. Positives: nice modern rooms. Overall I would recommend the Harborside Inn (better value and free WIFI) and the Charlesmark (better value and much better location).",0

"We stayed - nights at this hotel after flying in from Australia and recuperated from the flight well. The room was aged, but clean and well maintained, the beds were great. 
Location of this hotel was great, the view excellent (water view) - Hyatt Guest room - accommodated - of us comfortably.
Front line staff were a bit reluctant (may have been the Aussie accent). Breakfast was ordinary - better options around town that cost less.
The location of the hotel allowed us to either walk or catch trams to explore San Francisco. We felt this was a good area and felt safe.
If you're looking for a centrally located, comfortable and clean hotel then I'd recommend this hotel and we'd stay again.",0
 Allocation to room 10011 i e next to the Sky Bar was a disaster This room should be decommissioned as it is geographically unsuitable for habitation Far too noisy However staff did allocate us a different room the next day PEACE AND TRANQUILITY at last No Positive,1
 I didn t like the fact that my partner accidentally left his bracelet on the side of the bathroom sink in plain view for all to see and when we returned to ask if it has been handed in it hadn t even though the room had been unoccupied since we had left at midday This meant the only people who had been in the room after us had been the cleaners or another member of staff We were outraged to find that a sentimental piece of jewlerry had actually been stolen by a member of hotel staff We are both disgusted with how this happened when you are supposed to be a reputable hotel We definitely will not be returning and certainly will not be recommending this thieving institute to anybody else  Breakfast,0

 We did not have breakfast at the hotel purely because of the cost which was extremely high There are plenty of places near by serving full breakfast at a fraction of the cost e g The Weatherspoons pub less than 5 mins away serves full cooked breakfast at 1 3rd of the price  Quad and triple rooms were very spacious Staff extremely friendly and accomodating,1

Their soaps smell delicious :) I have nothing else to say except that I will be repeat business!,1

 Concierge desk unhelpful and unprepared They were uncertain about the validity of the UK EU driving licence as as a valid ID We had to debate the issue for far too long They were surprised by the fact we booked with booking com it felt booking com clients got treated as a lower category type of client we were given a room on the basement with limited access to light and view on the internal courtyard I was on my way out with luggage in my hand when i was offered an upgrade As my wife just had an operation i didnt fell like searching for another hotel For an euro800 overnight stay i was extremely disappointed The breakfast was served in a tiny place extremely uncomfortable next to a veranda overlooking a parking lot Only positive note the Don Carlos service Charming maitre No Positive,0

 The room had no balcony like on the pictures Worse it didn t even have a real window i e an opening to the exterior allowing you to see the sky check the weather know if it s day or night etc It only had a window going to a sort of large inner ventilation shaft which had a roof and was very noisy  Good breakfast buffet clean room with parquet floor ,0
No Negative The care taken by all workers from the night attendant reception to the breakfast chef and house cleaner made our stay very enjoyable We will certainly stay again ,1
We could have nice time in the lovely house. Good location and spacious rooms. There is a new air conditioner but old ones in each room. Thanks for providing us some foods in fridge.,1
 room underground wifi didn t work friendly staff,0
 The room and bed are quite small We had a room viewing the street and at night it got very very loud so that there was no way you could sleep Another thing that wasn t very pleasant was the fact that the cleaning lady would knock on our door every morning at 7 30 8 am for maintenance  Location Clean preety rooms Helpful staff at front desk ,0
 Almost nothing except for the blockage on the credit card upon arrival Also the city tax should be included in the pre payment having to pay the city tax at the end of the stay is frustrating and disappointing since we chose our stay to be pre paid Nice comfortable rooms and beds Very very helpful and friendly staff Overall cleanliness was fairly satisfying Very good location nice walk to the metro station pretty big shopping area and plenty of good restaurants right behind the bijlmer arena station The I Max cinema was a bonus too ,1
 Trying to save money with very important things like heating or hot water is not a good idea too obvious and annoying I haven t seen this never ever in my life and we go to many hotels around the world Rooms are quite small  The staff in the morning is extremely kind and sweet Nice deco and lobby Super quiet elevator ,0
 The walls are so thin that I could hear someone typing a text message in the room next door Earplugs are a must  Location honest bar where you can go and make your own drinks the price is a bit to high though My room was very tiny but classy The bathroom was a good size ,1
"Enjoyed our stay very much. The renovations are beautiful and tasteful. The lobby is warm and inviting. As soon as you step in the front doors all you want to do is have a seat and relax. 
The hotel staff is wonderful and so attentive. Well organized and extremely hospitable. The Blue Bar is a fun place to have a drink at anytime, however the blue lighting is a bit overbearing. It took awhile for our eyes to become adjusted. 
The rooms are very clean and organized. 
The bed is extremely comfortable and gave me the best night sleep away from home of all time. 
It's centralized location put it within walking distance to everything and the ability to retreat into a more quiet atmosphere at your discretion. 
My new favorite place to stay in NYC.",1
 The milk in the mini bar was out off date Available parking,1
 During check in I was waiting 40 minutes near the desk for registration issues to be solved without any welcoming drink although I asked a glass of water The square of room and hotel was not appropriate  Location Wi Fi Mr Massimo was very polite ,0
 Very small rooms noisy thin walls and an old type of windows make sure that you won t get good sleep weak airconditioning uncomfortable bed just like unfriendly staff with one exception the young male who was helpful but for example young woman in glasses should work in a tax department not with travellers who come to the hotel looking for smiled staff and friendly service I see it in some hotels fortunately not often unpleasant office people at the front desk who know the rules and regulations and know how to work on the computer this is too little to make it a good place to stay Excellent location close to the underground in a beautiful part of London,0
"This hotel is in a super location: lots of restaurants, good transportation nearby, shopping, attractions (zoo), bars, etc. The one problem we had was that the doormen or bellman (hard to tell which were which) had bad odors. It hits you as soon as you get in the doors. They hand out just inside the front doors to the hotel. I think the check in staff should be awarre of this since they have to walk past these smelly guys too. Otherwise, I don't have many complaints. The rooms are a little small but you really can't beat the price for the location. The front desk is very nice and very good about answering questions. There is one computer in the lobby - two would be better since it is hard to get on it most of the time.",0

 Staff are hard to understand was given a disabled room were the shower was just on the wall which left the water all over the toilet floor without a divider paying over 300 pounds it was not worth the money plus paying 60 pounds for parking Location was good,0

 The spa is not very spacious and costs 15 per person for 2 hours extra The shower in the bathroom was annoying as the water pressure was very low and the plates that were on the shower floor shifted and tilted while stepping on them I was afraid that I might fall The light in the bathroom and room is not good for applying makeup Confusing lighting system in the room  The bar on the ground floor was good The rooms are spacious and have a good modern design The bathroom offers a good hair dryer The spa is nice and offers some relaxing things like a steam bath a salt grotto almost like a pool and a Finnish sauna the spa is not suitable for children ,1
 The breakfast spread choice was limited Bar layout also has room for improvement could there be walls separating from main check in queues ambience was diminished during peak hours Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant upon check in and very informative when responding to queries,1
 The room is inhumanly small and out of shape  Nothing luckily I stayed only one night ,0
 Standard room is far too small and very very uncomfortable Door to bathroom was broken Cannot wash face as sink is too small Toilet area is far to small and your shoulders touch both walls when you attempt to sit down Extractor fan is the loudest I have ever heard and takes an age to turn off Should not have to pay for wifi No water in rooms and 4 for a very small bottle in the bar is scandalous  Good reception area Very good breakfast Good location ,0

 The staff at the restaurant was completely impolite didn t give us a table even though the restaurant was empty We went to the hotel next door and we had a great dinner even though they were quite full but they were polite and offered a table The bathtub was not working properly and they didn t do anything about it The windows were not opening for the money the room costed it was totally not worth it  Nothing ,0

 the food was not at all at a 4 level no fresh bread bumpy like from the day before no fresh whole weet bread almost every product contains chocolate jam or some extra sugar no fresh made coffee or juices spa was a reason why we booked then we realized reservation was necessary and that there where extra costs prices for the parking are way too high because the streets are very new no navigation system also google couldn t navigate us to you staff was efficient and competent but unfriendly we never experienced such a bad price quality ratio in a 4 hotel  15 minutes walk from EXPO nice rooms,0

 Pillows rock hard very uncomfortable  The Bed was very good and standard of Hotel very good Staff efficient but not that friendly Bar come restaurant over priced ,0
 We were told our room would have a view of the platform but what we had was the view of the roof only with laser vision would we have seen the platform Interestingly I have just been contacted by the fraud office of my bank saying that someone has tried to do a transaction in the USA with my card details there may be absolutely no connection but it might be worth checking your customer payment security luckily no harm done and the bank stopped the payment  We loved being so close to Kings Cross with no arduous journey across town with luggage we loved eating in the Booking Office the banana smoothie offered whilst we were booking in everyone saying good morning the grand entrance and how pleasant the desk staff were ,1

This is a very small inn with no view in ANY of the rooms. It is located --- block from Union Square and all the amazing shopping and restaurants. We were moved from a very small room (european standard small) b-c of a plumbing issue. The next room was much better. Loved the staff and the daily free wine and cheese each evening. LOVED our - nights there. AMAZING staff at the desk who helped us with any questions and gave recommendations. The price was $--- a night in early April which was waaaay cheaper than other properties we researched. We felt that it was a GREAT deal and worth the savings from the big chain hotels.,1
 Nothing Just marvelous hotel can not ask for better for this value ,1
 We booked the main hotel and actually stayed in the annexe I specifically requested a high floor and was on floor 1 Beds were tiny width and length No facilities in the annexe whatsoever Car parking was extra in excess of 30 00 for no time at all very expensive for what was on offer probably will never return  Location Food in Frankies was 8 10 staff behind the bar though were useless simply no personality ,0

The Airbnb is not all the same as in the pictures. <br/>When we arrived the sheets and towels were dirty. <br/>We wanted to go out in the evening but we were blocked and couldnt go out. We called the owner but he wasnt really responsif. Luckily a random person helped us.,0
 the rooms need updating the first room had a dirty throw on the bed did not even get in it and also the bathroom had plumbing problems Second room broken chair plug sockets to turn off lights behind bed big chips in the bath Third room ok still marks in the bath  the staff very helpful and willing to please,0
No Negative Hotel layout was open and airy There were several public areas to sit in where we were always able to find a quiet spot Call buttons in these areas meant service was easily available without staff always being there Location suited us as we were within easy reach of the main tourist attractions without being in the busiest areas ,1
 Hotel is tired Looks exactly what it is 1980 s Breakfast process is poor Buy a ticket for 10 or add it to your bills 13 50 Restaurant staff want to clear you out the moment you arrive Breakfast is 1970 s Little Chef Hardly cutting edge capital city  Worst hotel in the best location in London ,0
 Great polite happy person checked me in person who checked me out bit cold and unfriendly Decor is a bit dated so if you like a modern environment this is not for you  Spacious room lovely comfy bed great en suite bathroom quiet location yet close to transport ,1
 Room size was a little on the small side but overall OK Why is it almost everywhere that when booking a double room there is only one luggage rack available Obviously two people are staying in the room and both normally would have their own suitcase One usually ends up on the floor In this hotel I cleared the nightstand and used it as the other stand for my suitcase  The breakfast buffet was very good A lot of variety and the staff were quick to provide coffee latte cappucino etc ,1

 That I had to share a bed would have preferred three single beds in the room as I went with my sister and brother The hotel was nice and relaxing,1
 The breakfast food in the on site city cafe was terrible and way over priced Eggs bacon were over cooked and sausages were dangerously under cooked We walked out feeling unsatisfied and robbed due to the extremely high cost of the buffet Another disappointment was the lack of a pool on site for such a high priced hotel  Gymnasium was in a great location on the top floor with excellent views although very small and under equipped Hotel staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 They forgot to service our room a bit unusual we thought  The atmosphere staff location bed view heritage everything,1
 Dissapointed in the food Also no heating very very cold Comfy bed,0
 As with all large hotels the food and drink is quite expensive I ate in the hotel as I was only my own due to my husband being out with clients Pasta a glass of wine and a bottle of water 35  It is very convenient location for the City of London Fenchurch Street Station and Tower Hill Tube Station ,1
 The parking entrance was a little difficult to find  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly ,1
 Couldn t fault anything really though they didn t stock up the tea and coffee for us in the room Very close for underground and lots of shops cafes and restaurants all round about Staff all very helpful and rooms very clean,1
 The room had a bad smell like a mix of chemicals and shits Also the room was so noisy You can hear what is happening in the next room and in front of the room And the staff start cleaning the other rooms early in the morning so you can forget to sleep a little bit more  Free parking next to the metro station comfortable bed and breakfast till 11 ,0
 The family rooms are too pricey given the extremely small sizes they come in  Direct access to the tube station plenty of taxis and tour buses regularly stationed at the hotel s entrance ,1
 problem with the room I have booked solved on the next day  location ,1

 Property needs some refurbishments as some of the fixtures are showing its age  For London standards rooms were quite big Hotel is not too far from the underground station Kilburn Park and there are bus stops nearby that service Westfield s Oxford street etc Another positive is that the rooms are fitted with multiple power points which makes charging multiple electrical devices so much easier ,0
 Since it said the hotel is near the station we didn t ride the cab anymore Bad choice as we had a challenging time finding the hotel upon our arrival  Boni the front office staff was very friendly helpful and accommodating He showed us where to go and what we can see in Milan ,1

 You couldn t open the window to get any fresh air it was screwed shut The view onto the back of the building behind was ordinary but we weren t in the room during the day The lift was supposed to hold 4 adults 2 adults fitted fine with luggage it was a struggle 2 people in the lift with luggage and no one else could get in The location was good it was about a 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe Lots of little places to eat around The breakfast was cheaper than eating out but still expensive for what it was ,0
 I have stayed in nicer hotels in London for a third of the price this place is not worth the money Very noisy Only mirror in the room was by the door the furthest point from the only plug sockets in the room so it was diffcult for my girlfriend to get ready Shower temperature was hard to get right A bose sound player was provided in the room with the iPhone adapter from 4 years ago Was told fridge got restocked it didn t My view was of the lobby so all I could see was the lift Terrible place don t waste your money Oh and they charged me twice  Bed was comfy and the buffet was decent,0

 Early in the morning we woke up by the noise right outside our room There were workers who held on to renovate the floor I think this is completely unacceptable and unprofessional of a 4 star hotel At least they could have closed the floor for the time of renovation The location of the hotel is not so great because of the railway you can hear trains that goes by And last thing was that I could not open my mini bar so I called concierge next day and it turned out that my deposit was not registered which was kind of a surprise to hear because I had paid it right after check in No Positive,0

 The one time I did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter On the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items Badly designed room Someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues  It s the 3rd time I ve booked this hotel On 2 occasions I have been moved to a neighbouring hotel The Lancaster Gate location was great Their Hyde Park location was OK The staff are always helpful ,0
 it was extremely noisy  the location is excellent for convenience,0
"Stayed here for - nights for a friends wedding. It is a nice place and location but there was nothing special about it. 
One thing i did not care for was that besides the $$$ spent on the room, they freaking charge you an occupation fee every night. We got a good deal for the wedding at $--- a night and then they charged us and additonal $-- a night on top of that. I assume all places in SF do that, but WTF. 
Just put the extra charge in the room price instead of showing me that you are going to charge me to stay in a room that i already am paying for.",0
 The location was not the best as it was a bit out something you don t quite realise until you are there the metro is only a few minutes walk away though  The apartments were fab very modern and clean and the staff were attentive ,1

The sink was rusted, the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, there was hardly room for one person in the bathroom, the toilet made noises all night and was old and dirty, the hot water in the sink didnt exist. The hot water in the shower was fine. The radiator heat made clanking noises all night. The bed was fine but the other furniture in the room was in not so great condition.

 Room was very small dark and in the basement The was low frequent noise during the night possibly from tube trains passing by underneath No Positive,0
 Very poor meal in the restaurant service average at best when we said our meal was just ok due to very tough steak and poor description of the meal we received a blank look no apology The couple on the next table had the same problem as seafood wasn t listed and the customer was allergic Food very inferior and over priced compared with some amazing places in London  convenience of hotel to moorfields ,0
 Unfortunately the staff was not really friendly as I arrived the check in was a bit unpleasant which shouldn t be at all I have not been informed that there was a fitness center in the hotel and the wifi didn t work In general unfortunately I wouldn t stay at this hotel again as the value for money was in the end negative  The room was quite big and the bed was comfortable,0
 old style windows have very little noise isolationNo Positive,1

 We have stayed many times at this hotel On this occasion we were put in a room that needed matainance This even flashed up on the computer but was still given to us Door handle broken and the air condition did not work in hot May Told our room would have a view when we got in to have a view of the next door office block looking into workers office This is classed as excecutive room Staff in restaurant not friendly or welcoming A change in atmosphere from previous stays but overall disappointed this time with the hotel  location,0
 Quiet not interfering barely noticeable remodeling was in progress on upper level Didn t sway opinion of the place especially for great room rate likely on that account  Skip eggs perfect of course We talking Ambasciadori here Breakfast sumptuous hard to try it all in one day no prompting for starting late for you know reasons Perfect espresso but Duomo Piazza awaits Noiseless staff buon giorno notte on all occasions Rooms w o comment perfect not much to say one can always complain about noise from Duomo cathedral close to hotel Single bell with slow grave tone v rarely used welcomed when heard Excellent location for La Scala and rest of Milano ,1
 Our room was facing the street and it was really noisy as the windows weren t good at all We also had water stains all over the roof So this was a really expencive hotel as the room was outdated and not in the status you woul expect from a hilton  The hotel is located right beside the River what gives it a nice touch The bed was good and the extras were nice too ,0
 I was VERY dissapointed with the room for the price i payed travelodge rooms are bigger just as comfortable with a bigger bed and they are cheaper if you get what you pay for im going to travelodge next time i stay in London overall feeling of being charged 156 for 1 night and nearly 40 for 2 breakfasts because they could and not because they are special even though they are a Hilton hotel i will NOT stay in any hilton hotels again and i would not recommend them either The warm friendly welcoming staff and the delicious warm cookies,1
 Lack of basic ventilation Comfortable enough but very tired Overpriced room and services such as breakfast or even coffee  Some of the staff were lovely others not so ,0
No Negative Very friendly staff and so helpful loved the downstair bar can t wait to come back,1
 Hotel staff left room open whilst out anyone could have entered roomNo Positive,0
 Shame the parking was extra and wasn t clear at point of booking Comfy bed good breakfast,1
 Only minor issue was slowness of service in the restaurant They were rushing around just not enough of them to get someone s attention Don t let it put you off Food was excellent and the staff very friendly  Wonderful place The experience is exactly what I look for in a hotel Personality comfort and decor spot on You ll get excellence but in a casual and accessible way I could wax lyrical about the helpfulness of the receptionist but I m too busy soaking up my final few minutes in the velvet wonderland of the lobby ,1
 First we got a very small and outdated room than upgrated for a bigger room and that made our stay a lot more pleasant The room service food before 10 30pm is good after that the food is terrible  Location is best for shopping,0
 Booked 3 superior double rooms but they were very small congested I m sorry to say my bathroom had stains around the wash area on the wall that was not cleaned previously toilet was stained and shower had black mould was very disappointed If a toilet was flushed in another room you could hear the eco in the room Just glad we only spent one night here  Have to commend NH Group for the excellent staff Once again they were very helpful hotel location is in a quieter part of Milan Location is near the train station and shops which makes it very convenient to transit ,0
 bar area a bit like a wimpy bar Also the restaurant area was more like a canteen However the food was far below even a canteen standard Wouldn t touch the cooked breakfast on offer Made do with fruit toast and coffee  nice clean modern room if with a gloomy outlook over work courtyards ,0
 Place in general is very tired Beds are not comfy or luxurious but sheets are very clean Bathroom is really outdated and in very poor condition  Location is great Room was hot due to good weather Room had an AC machine which is great to cool down room quickly but it s very bulky and very very noisy,0
 We had difficulty booking in Staff on reception a little casual regarding our booking couldn t find it Then informed us it was only one night and then didn t realise already pre paid Good thing I had a hard copy of my booking and confirmation Although room was good size it was still stuffy Room over decorated and too many lamps  Location was great Breakfast was very varied and good Room size good obviously you get what u pay for Bathroom spacious Shower and pressure just average If you are tall it would be difficult to have a shower comfortably Although the hotel was busy it was still quiet and plenty of space to sit downstairs ,0
 nothing Everything was as we expected and more Loved staying here and will come again,1
 really run down and not cleanNo Positive,0
 The room had a bed smell of cigarettes Travelling with small children you could expect that they would be more helpful in finding solution though didnt help much  Location,0
No Negative Location is great Delicious breakfast Wonderful staff ,1
 The rooms are tiny litertly tiny would be fine for one night but not more than that The bathroom door is glass and doesnt completely close so not much privacy and the walls are pretty thin Rooms have no tv or wardrope drawers they do have hangers on the wall  Good Location Friendly Staff Lobby area is really nice and a bit different ,1
"My wife and I were in Memphis for my -- year reunion. I had heard many good things about this hotel and they all seemed to be true. The staff was top notch, both friendly and proffessional. The suite was spacious and clean. The breakfast the next day was crowded but good.
However, if you are looking for a super quiet hotel for the weekend this is not it. Beale street is one block away and the music plays till -am. The lobby could be a bit bigger as could the breakfast area. 
Overall however this is a very nice hotel and I would reccomend it to anyone.",1
 Variable service from the staff at times good but other times terrible hence no consistency Towels were not changed regularly At times we had to share the towels  The bed was comfortable The food was satisfactory ,0
 One thing I didn t like in particular was the fact that we weren t given any additional water apart from the first day rooms were very small tiny even what you can t see on the pictures the staff was really nice,0

 Nothing Perfect location,1
 Room to small to take bed Bathroom too small Heating inadequate or not working King size bed very comfortable,0
 Very unprofessional and poor reception took us 2 hours to check in and an hour to check out old and broken furniture to the extend that there were nails sticking out of the the cabinets they claim of having free wifi but they don t say that signal doesn t reach every room  The location only ,0
 Cleanness of the bathroom Over worn out towels Poor quality and old furniture equipment in the room Room photos on the hotel s site have nothing to do with the room I was given I thought I entered a wrong hotel  Very good location Very good breakfast Helpful staff ,0
 Over priced breakfast for what it is eaten cheaper for better quality Rooms not worth the price I would prefer a budget hotel for more space and same view from the window  Location was ideal for us,0
 A little further away from the airport than I expected  The aircon and the garden restaurant ,1
 Location is in the middle of nowhere 10 km from city center Metro is 2km far walking in a completely desert area Value not worthy the price paid Nothing,0
 Service was slow bags weren t in room upon arrival room service food was not hot when it arrived you pay for the name not for an exceptional stay Location decor and attitude of staff was excellent,0
 Noisy and small room which wasn t value for money Friendly reception and modern look of the place,0
 Bad service not well clean stuff frowned Location,0
I left a white night shirt on the bed in my hotel room. After I checked out I stopped back in & called & talked to the housekeeping staff so I could pick it up and no one seems to knows anything about my night shirt and did not even seem to care.,0
 Size of room it was small and basic I ve had better facilities in other brand hotels at cheaper prices in fact better facilities at the Glasgow thistle Breakfast was extra at 200 per night there having a laugh  The rooms were basic and small,0
No Negative location and view,1
 Overall for The Hilton Group is a renowned hotelier however I found that the staff were pretty glum I got woken up by the room cleaner at 8 15am we were booked for checking out at 12 00am Generally very disappointed as I was celebrating our 20th wedding Anniversary and wanted some special treatment felt let down Had requested via a phone call before our arrival to the staff of the fact that a complimentary surprise for my wife would have been a good gesture but I had to remind the staff for that as well  The only thing I liked was the location ,0
 Worst mattress we ve ever slept on No Positive,0
 Air conditioning a little loud but needed to be on as it was 30 degrees outside  Great location quiet rooms very friendly and helpful staff great breakfast and service from Maria easy check in and out useful maps and guides given at check in comfy air conditioned reception at the end of a long hot day s site seeing,1

 only thing missing and is a tiny thing would of been nice to have a little fridge as we bought extra milk and water with us  i couldnt fault the hotel everything was far better than i thought it would be and the staff were really lovely everywhere was so clean and the bed was really comfy ,1
 The walls were thin the shower drips loudly all night and sounds like water is flushing around you you can hear the neighbors very loudly I woke up with bites from bed bugs and it is almost impossible to organize pre payment for this hotel when I arrived they made it very difficult and stressful to sort out There were tea and coffee amenities,0

 Nothing it was all good Great location good size room Very helpful staff ,1
 I picked this hotel specifically above others and paid more for it as it had a pool available I swim everyday When I got there the pool was out of commission There was no indication on the booking com website that the pool wouldn t be available and I received no update and the hotel said that it was mentioned on their website which was no use to me as I used booking com No Positive,0

No Negative Fantastic location excellent dinners,1
 Road noise but it s to be expected in central London Could do with triple glazing if it s not a listed building Position for the DLR Station and the ease of gettin to and from Euston even on a Sunday,1
 The only thing that I had an issue with was our room was facing the room The noise level was very high it felt like the windows were open So the beds were very comfortable but not much sleep due to the noise Other than that the hotel was amazing Reception was amazing very clean and bright,1
 Lift was a little slow  Good sized rooms ,1
 I was disappointed the Spa was unavailable for treatments as that was the main reason I chose this hotel The Spa was under new management so my online bookings for treatment requests had not been acknowledged  It was a beautiful hotel Very friendly and efficient staff ,1
 We got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening The bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed The power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices I think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience Location and proximity to tube and park,0
 Small room small double bed No Positive,0
 recommend damping of room door closure even with self adhesive squidgy discs just to take the edge off any door bang No Positive,1
 Charged extra 90 pounds for staying until 5pm on the Sunday of check out However in the event was double charged once through debit card and once through credit card  The breakfast was OK but the scrambled eggs were cold but put right after I complained bed was comfortable and room was well furnished,0
 Parties in the lobby until 3am rooms seem soundproof but you can still hear a lot of noise Room comfort is a bit poor for the price no storage space no bathroom intimacy Cleaning services could be improved mini bar never got replenished in 4 days some dirty sheets were left in the room Shampoo is very harsh and there is no confitioner Decoration ambiance is very hip nice great lobby bar Location is central Loved the patio for the superior rooms on the P floor,0

 Wish the lobby could be re designed and made more welcoming The reception staff were fantastic though  Hotel is centrally located Fantastic transport links Overlooks Hyde Park The rates available just before Christmas were an absolute bargain 100 a night for a lovely room It s almost a 4 5 Star Hotel ,1
 Would prefer coffee and tea brought to table rather than machine in a good hotel Furnishings looking rather tired No bottled water in room or robes Bathroom shower curtain was either underfoot in bath or flooded the bathroom if outside one of the bar staff was quite rude Service charge on bar drinks charged haven t come across this before  Location Most staff were friendly and efficient Breakfast good ,0

 The room was very cramped no place to open a suitcase  Staff were very helpful Location very convenient for use of public transport especially to and from the airport ,0
 I was surprised that people could smoke inside the hotel on the 1st floor in front of the restaurant I do not think it is now appropriate to have people smoking in closed public areas A pity that the lift did not get directly to the room on the first floor and that you had to go up some stairs Not very convenient when you are carrying heavy bags  The room was big and very comfortable I was able to work in good conditions thanks to the internet connection and other facilities ,1
 Strange smell in the shower Drain  Large comfortable room Excellent bed Very quiet at night so good restful sleep possible Spacious bathroom with twin wash basins shower AND bathtub Tram and metro station just a few steps away Shop and bakeries situated conveniently in the station Bank right next door to hotel Short walk 15 mins to the historic city centre and famous superb cafes for breakfast Wouldn t want to stay anywhere else in Vienna Loved it ,1

 Very small room and had to move things around to get into wardrobe We were at the front of the hotel This was not good when there were two 7am to 11pm convenience stores having deliverys through the night underneath our window  Lots of breakfast fare ,0
The good news is that the Pier - is very well located and has two good restaurants Ruth’s Chris Steak House and McCormick and Schmick’s as well as Pizzazz Tuscan Grille right there. The bad news is that our room was very musty and had a very noisy through the wall heating system. There is a construction site across the street and they started work early (even though it was Saturday). Would look for another hotel in Baltimore if we visit again.,0
 Rooms are tiny and no choice of restaurants Low rate in a good location Staff were friendly,0
 Noisy room Booked three beds and got double and camp bed Emailed hotel twice no response to my complaint Roof top bar though expensive,0

 The tram The incek,0
 The hotel did not provide the valet parking for my car The front dest ask me to take my car to the parking The house keeping takes long time to turn around the room The bathroom is old and requires renovation  I spent 3 nights with my wife in September The Hotel location is very good The lobby is renovated well furnished and confortable ,0
"Hotel is nice enough in aesthetics and certainly in location. However, the room was not the cleanest and the bathroom verged on grotesque with the overlooked crud in the corners, and hair that clearly belonged to a barbarian of a man, apparently with a highly progressed hair loss ailment. I paid -- dollars for the room through hotwire, so taking price into consideration, its descent. I WOULD NOT stay here at -- or -- or even -- dollars a night. If you are looking for the best deal on polaris parkway, stay at Cambria Suites. Impeccable, reasonable, and nearly brand new. 
we'll see if breakfast bagels redeems the extended stay in the morning!",0

 Room was so hot The air conditioning cooled it down but the cool air draught became uncomfortable Staff Friendly and helpful Rooms Clean Good D cor Restaurant food lovely,1
The bed was extremely uncomfortable - hard as a rock. Intresting they try to promote the sale of their bed linens like some other chains. I had a junior suite but it was as cheaply furnished and decorated as a ----'s motel. Poor and general lack of lighting. $-.-- morning cup of coffee at a serve yourself bar by a money anticipated type. The location is excellent but hotel quality and comfort really lacked. Have done much better in Chicago for the same money and location.,0
 Bathrooms are awful No Positive,0

 This hotel is advertised as a 5 star but sadly more 3 star plus our usual 5 star hotel was fully booked we won t stay at the Grange again A tired dated looking hotel Overpriced for quality A disappointment for our monthly visit Staff fairly pleasant and big bedroom,0
 Was accused of buy a bottle of vodka which we didn t have and asked to pay for it infront of a bar full of people later told they check CCTV and in fact it wasn t us Very embarrassing for us TV never worked correctly shower leaked onto bathroom floor couldn t control temp on shower either Cold breakfast after arriving 40 mins later than was said it would Worse thing was after talking to 3 different managers we was told we would be compensated but we wasn t at all Very disappointed and I hope they at least contact to acknowledge my complaints  Location was good for us ,0

Had a long chat with several of the people working at the desk during a wine hour, and they were charming and personable. Remembered me by name the next few days, and made me feel like I was with friends and family. Johnny's smile and greetings made it a pleasure to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""come home"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from work. Fabulous restaurant next door - Bistro Bis. Lovely room. Great location within walking distance of Union Station. Would stay here all the time if I could get good enough room rates!",1

No Negative For staying in a nice district like that in Paris the price was quite fair Although the same type of rooms according to their reception are very much different Plus the receptionists need to be more professional with the issueing of invoices ,0
 Nothing to really not like a bar fridge in the room would have given the hotel a 10 for facilities  The location of the hotel was great staff were helpful and knowledgeable and gave good dinner recommendations Also the hotel provides a snack buffet in the evenings if you buy a drink from the bar so if you don t feel like going out for a full dinner this is more than enough ,1
 room was a little cramped Nice helpful staff,1
No Negative The view,0
 The restaurant in the hotel is very poor the service is very bad Make sure to check your bill The location is awful don t feel safe outside at night  Nice big bed ,0
 The fact that no complimentary water bottle was provided in the room Excellent experience,1
 When I arrived to hotel at 11 am the receptionist told us that check in will be at 3 pm When I told them that I should have an early check in as a genius member in Booking com they did not consider this and told me that we can offer another room without Effie view as I reserved at the same price So do not consider any genius priority There is no double bed only two beds closed together No room facilities and should be under special request  The location of the hotel is good and easily transport to airport Metro station is close and congress center is on beside 15 20 min walking distance from Arc de Champ Baggage reservation is available Good security system ,0

 The room we booked was not available for the first night The hotel warned us 2 hours before our plane took off This is not acceptable for such an hotel They couldn t arrange for another room in the same hotel even for a lower standard one They finally find a room in another hotel When we arrived at the hotel the front desk people seem to be unaware of our situation They finally upgraded our room where restroom had no door and offered the breakfast for the morning after Again the people in the breakfast room was not aware that we ve been offered the breakfast What a surprising lack of communication for such an hotel  The room was comfortable except the restroom had no door ,1
No Negative fantastic atmosphere very relaxed and friendly staff really good location 5 from Amstrdam Zuid train station a bit outside the noisy city center,1
 I feel this hotel is very over priced You do not pay for the hotel here you pay for the location I had the executive double room i was told it was the biggest available but it was definitely so small I was shocked that it could be called an executive room If that is executive i feel terribly sorry for the people who paid for a standard room It must have been like a box  The spa was very nice,0
 Rooms are small There is a construction happening in front of the hotel It was very disturbing The staff,0
 The check in took around 45 minutes Then they gave us a room that had a strong smell of cigar They took another 45 minutes to finally give us another room The pool area is not very clean and well entertained The pool itself is very small taking into account the amount of rooms and people in the hotel Location Is not that close to Sagrada Family nor Barcelona city center  We liked the waiters in the snack bar They were very nice and quick and another staff member who helped us for the room change We also liked the small kids play area even though simple our kids loved it ,0
 Staff cannot speak English properly near to train and super market,0
 A bit pricey The location couldn t be more perfect ,1
 Rooms are getting a bit tired could do with some painting Fitness center could be expanded folks these days like to work out and there s ample room in floor 1 to make it bigger and better The location is fabulous Excellent value for money,1

 The food was pretty poor My Burger came up wrong and pasta was very bland  Other then the food situation the whole stay was faultless,1
 The room originally provided had no windows to open for fresh air I was struggling to breath upon complaining about this matter I was advised nearly all of the rooms have no windows So changing rooms was not an option upon asking for the name of the reception staff whom am I speaking to as I will be processing an official complaint in this matter The reception staff refused to provide his name and advised me he will speak to the manager and call me back With out any further conversation the phone was cut off Five minutes later a room with a window is available No Positive,0
 The bed was extremely hard The room was far too hot and we were told the air con unit didn t work We were charged an extra 50 in case we damaged anything however this was not explained and the money was taken out of my account without consent and not returned until 3 days later  The views were stunning and the bar was lovely and drinks were good ,0

 Car park was limited and very tight to get in The pub that is attached to hotel drinks expensive and food average and expensive  Comfortable beds clean and tidy ,1
 We liked nothing Staff was ill mannered response to calls was extremely poor as every time we had to call at least two to three time even to get a smaller things Check in and check out both were extremely pathetic as every time you had to stand in the queue at least 25 45 minutes Overall in spite of our best efforts we could not find a single good thing in this hotel We had come to this hotel direct from Atlantis Dubai and then from Hilton Venice As compared to both of above hotels your hotel was at worst position having no comparison at all and extremely incompatible as far as value for money is concerned  Nothing at all ,0
 The breakfast was repetitious always the same things We would have liked having a pancake or waffles for a change but we would have had to pay additional all hotels will have been to would not have an extra charge for this After spending 10 days The food had become very blah Always the scramble eggs which usually were cool and not tasty sausage and ham were very greasy The pastries were the only good choice  The second best was not very comfortable ,0
 Terrible staff Very unhelpful Location,0
 Rooms are too smallNo Positive,0
 Only thing I didn t like was that our visited had to come to an end  From the minute we were greeted at the front door until they put us in a taxi for the trip to the airport my sister in law and I were treated like queens We arrived early off a cruise ship and were offered a cup of coffee while we waited in the very comfortable bar lounge area With in half an hour our room was ready and our host came personally to get us Our bags were waiting when we entered the room Room was very comfortable especially the beds I can only hope we can return in the near future Location was perfect ,1
 Wifi internet was VERY slow nice international touch good new clean fitness center nice staff Good location ,1
"I spent five nights in this motel. It is recent, not new, and very well kept. The public areas are nice, the room (one queen) was spacious with much desk space. Breakfast with self-made waffles, eggs, patties, donuts, bagels etc. (no yogurt) was excellent. Staff pleasant, friendly and efficient. No surcharge for receiving faxes, wake-up calls or local---- calls. Nice pool and jacuzzi. The way all motels should be. I checked nearby comparable motels, this one offered the best price for value.",1
 The room was son small I could pull my travel bag around in the room I cold not sit on the toilet straight as l the bathroom was so small and the sink was in the way and the toilet too close to the wall  The place seemed really nice My room was so small it should be called a maids den or a closet Really disappointed that a hotel could have a room so small and sell it I was not impressed at all ,0

 Rooms were in a shabby and very run down state Beds were basic and bathroom barely adequate This hotel has plummeted in standard in the last 15 years When we stayed here last it was the Hilton Mews and it was a very high standard small hotel Small is fine when quality is good The breakfast was most disappointing a very basic one star buffet with poor quality food When I last stayed here a very high quality English breakfast was served from the kitchen I don t mind a buffet if it is a high standard but this was rubbish  Good location walking distance to tube and access to Hyde Park,0

 The Room First Allocated was the size of a Janitor cupboard with a shower that due to age and decay would not switch on We asked for a change of room and got one which was a vast improvement The quality of the food in the carvery was unbelievable and not in a good way We planned to eat breakfast in the hotel but after our first experience with their best efforts at cooking we wisely decided to eat out  Location is brilliant,0
 Rate clean comfort Tv channel lobby Location,1
"We just stayed one night at the Residence Inn San Diego Mission Valley-Sea World Area, June -----, ----. The hotel room was clean and spacious. Our - year old enjoyed the second bedroom with bunk beds that we didn't expect. The biggest draw back is the noise. You can hear everyone around you. The walls are very thin. The breakfast is good. Many items to choose from, hot and cold and fresh fruit. We did feel safe at the hotel. We didn't feel all that safe at the local outdoor mall. And we are from LA. Pool was fine too. Overall, I wouldn't stay again. For the price, I would rather stay near the beach next time.",0

 It was the worst experience of a lifetime At around 10pm a couple just opened the door while I was half naked in bed and I almost passed out as I had a panic attack My son saw them from afar and rushed back to the room I had the greatest scare of my life and I am going to ask for legal advice on this matter as they claimed I occupied their room Apparently their room was changed but they still had the keys to my room 042 Ithought they were criminals as they could not speak English Glad I did not travel alone I would have been dead if my son did not come in No Positive,0
 Bathroom disappointing that there was no bath but the staff were very understanding and gave us a complimentary breakfast to make up for it  Cocktails stunning,1
 Stayed in the annex which mean t having to walk to the bar and breakfast in the rain No restaurant facility in the evening  Excellent friendly helpful staff very comfortable cosy hotel,1
 The breakfast buffet didn t have the assortment you would expect in a four star hotel Also we didn t get refill on soap so we had to ask for more at the reception The rooms were quite small and the wall paper started to come off in certain places  The hotel is within walking distance to the beach and it s possible to use the hotel s beach towels ,0

No Negative Free river trip,1
 Checkin was very slow and had to pay in advance Too expensive for what it has to offer but correct for Vienna  Simple and clean with all needed facilities Staff correct but not specially helpful Close to Stadthalle and very close to Lugner City so a lot of restaurants and cafes you can choose from Also some basic shopping possible 2 min from the metro station Big bathroom with basic toiletries Parking garage nearby with 15 eur 24 hours Decoration really basic facilities really basic ,1

 Arrived a bit early and room wasn t ready came back when told to and still it wasn t ready asked if they would call us when it s ready and they agreed we waited another hour no call and so just tried again and finally we were checked in Not a great start to your trip when you re tired from traveling No Positive,0
 The area that the hotel was situated in was dodgy to say the least Walking from Gare De Nord to the hotel did not feel safe especially at night  The hotel was very nice Bed comfortable and room perfect for what we wanted The room was a little small but in an old city like Paris it is to be expected Cannot fault it ,1
 Nothing  Fantastic location just a short hop to Chinatown and shows Room was lovely if a little on the small side but to be fair it is pot luck rather than design as on our last two stays we had huge rooms Again a little pricy at 23 per head for full on breakfast 14 for continental but I have to say it is one of the best I have had anywhere you can eat up and not feel hungry till 4 or 5pm so probably works out ok Staff were lovely as always and could not have been more helpful giving us a later check out with no drama or cost Also can I recommend a little place to eat just across from the hotel behind the M and M Shop and W Hotel a restaurant called Lobster and Hamburger fantastic Lobster roll Try it ,1
 The hotel is tired Paint is chipped and the hotel needs to be refurbished For the price charged 260 sterling one can find better hotels  The location is very good and the staff friendly ,0

"Just returned from a - night (dec -- - --) stay with my wife and kid. Staff were courteous, the size of the room is ok but the t&b is a bit small. One major complaint however is their aircon. Especially during the wee hours of the morning, both nights my wife and I woke up because the aircon is simply not enough to cool the room. Maybe that is the reason why they have a small fan inside the closet. I have read a complaint from another site with the same problem. The thing we like most about the hotel is the great location. Easy walk to Universal studios.",0
 noisy loud music in event room above until 1 a m had to complain to front desk noisy fan for heat in room difficult to get good night rest lower floor with view of a roof top and fire stair Overall not pleasant or very restful  location and overall amenities room was nice ,0

 No derogs Location Dave the concierge ,1
 They didn t mention anything that the parking is not included in the price and when we left they told us about that The girl at the reception realized it was not ok to ask money for that since there was no mentioning about it so they covered for it Also we paid the breakfast the day we checked in and every morning we had to wait at the restaurant because they didnt see our reservation  The hotel is nice and clean the stuff is professional The location is central there is a mall just near it streets with restaurants,1
 rooms are too small and tiny  friendly staff,0

No Negative Lovely hotel Close tube to everywhere Gave us 3 complimentary cookies which makes it a bit extra special Good check out time too and room was ready when we arrived at 10 30 am and no extra charge for early check in ,1
 One member of staff at reception was very unfriendly and unhelpful throughout our stay There was no air condition in the entire building so we barely slept In relation to facilities the bar is connected onto the reception desk very small area that we certainly wouldn t consider to be described as a bar  The hotel is located close enough to the underground The guests can avail of the use of a computer and printer ,0
 Nothing in particular  The hotel is close to Garde de Lyon which enables one to travel quite easy by train Also not far from the Seine We used the boats on the Seine to travel to most of the sightseeing attractions ,1
No Negative Comfy bed spotless hotel great location ,1
 My booking form confirmed a city view I was put into room 3 on the ground floor which had a window looking out onto another wall no more than 2 meters away with a view of bird droppings on the ground in between I would not have wanted to do anything other than sleep in that room with the curtains closed consequently I went out for most of the evening The room was comfortable but I was definitely tucked away into the corner and they were probably surprised that I didn t complain  The staff were very nice and the location good for my visit ,0
 Everything was slow not enough reception staff to keep queues down Lift was very small and slow given the size of the hotel  Great spa facilities Good sized room ,0
 Very few complaints although walk in shower was slightly strange design the glass partition only extended about two foot out from the wall so most of the water ended up over the bathroom floor But a very minor issue  Great location good staff decent rooms and good facilities particularly good value on a special deal ,1
 Windows don t open and stuffy room Old and dirty finally we changed the hotel wasted money No Positive,0
 Restaurant staff were quite slow and needed prompting for more coffee Also seemed to ignore a lot of customers saw several potential customers give up and go away Think you hotel really needs a residents lounge bar something I was very surprised to see was missing Have stayed in quite a number of Doubletree hotels in the past and the lack of that facility was very noticeable  The room was fine,0
 No fridge in room only one water per person during stay and only two waters in vending machine  Nice modern clean rooms hotel decor very stylish Great easy access to tram station which takes you straight into town Friendly staff very quiet location with nearby amenities including nice modern cafe Drovers Dog ,1
 We had no hot water the first night so had to go out dirty It wasn t fixed until the Sunday morning yet we were charged full price Very poor  The Hotel is clean tidy and comfortable breakfast was very good ,0
"The major flaw of this hotel is that the majority of hotel rooms are connected to the adjacent room through a shared door. These doors are not sound insulating and all noise from the adjacent room is heard. As such, there is the feeling of a loss of privacy as well as distracting noise. This problem could be remedied by the hotel owners replacing the doors with higher quality sound insulaters or closing with dry wall. As such, I would not stay here again.",0
 My room was clean and well appointed but very small and cramped Pristine breakfast facilities with a good choice of food,0
 No tea or coffee making facility in room Loved room staff excellent,1
 Staff at entrance was pretty rude when arriving early for check in despite having informed the hotel beforehand Only when asked if she s going to kick me out she offered my baggage to leave there The rooms are super tiny though if you have hand luggage only and for 1 night it is bearable My room only had a window in the bathroom kinda claustrophobic sleeping in a blind room Lots of strong LED lights in the rooms which cannot be switched off  Location,0

 I booked a 2 night stay Never like the ground room I was placed in on arrival But this was fairly resolved for my next day stay with a king size suite complemented by the manager  I liked the rooms on the upper level ,1
 The staff were not very friendly or helpful Nothing was explained to us on arrival with regards to opening hours of bar or any other services offered It s a shame as this hotel has great potential to be fabulous Location is fantastic but the lack of services and staff let it down  Location was excellent Very central The reception area was traditional and very grand just as expected Impressive to enter but the bar was closed early every evening so didn t even get a chance to visit after day out ,0
 Room service food was nice but not as good as I perhaps expected I was hoping for a little closer to restaurant quality whereas it was probably more pub than restaurant Malmaison for example is far better  Reception staff in particular were very friendly Same girl at check in and checkout ,1
 The pool was small and perfectly formed but it was too cold Too small to swim in so really it should have been heated like a hot tub then would have been perfect Similarly the sauna didn t seem to heat up to a very good temperature at all  Charming little boutique hotel with pool Beautiful individually decorated rooms with opera themes Loved the duplex suites ,1

 Mix up with the check in would have preferred a choice of where to sit at breakfast Staff friendly nice ambience walking distance to the Albert Hall,1
 Queen room very poorly Decoratered view from the room was disappointing The carpet was worn along the corridors and in the bedroom Fire alarm woke us up at 545 am and there was no staff helping or showing people how to evacuate Very disappointed as it was a birthday treat  Location was good The staff at the skyline bar were very friendly,0
 the quality of the linen and towels lower than the standard and not in line with the global high level standard of the hotel and the amenities the spa it is just a sauna but to say the truth for a weekend you barely have the time to go anyway Excellent location A mix between B B and hotel great decoration original and comfortable the breakfast room and the living rooms,1
 Staff was in my opinion unfriendly not to say rude The wall behind the curtains was very dirty  The hotel was well priced for a 4 star hotel,0
 Very small and hot room Everything is paid extra breakfast spa parking Really not worth the money for a 4 hotel  The spa when not too crowded Position close to metro station ,0
No Negative The service is FANTASTIC everyone was TOP We honestly were very impressed with how hospitable the staff was They gave us a free upgrade without us even asking The breakfast crew TOP Overall a fantastic experience ,1

 We traveled with 2 year old baby and got room with window towards main road and it was very noisy window was no soundproof so tram voice and other vehicles voice coming most of the night early morning and baby could not sleep so it was not good for all of us  Location breakfast and room was very clean,0
 Some changes at breakfast area is not welcoming that was your strongest side and now the tables location and food not the same If you keep going this direction we have to find the other place Please stay as you was for years that was your quality  It s still our favorite hotel in Milan,1
 Bathroom a little small 628 but they are updating rooms Shower did not work properly Kept going hot and cold It may have had something to do with the workmen next door But we managed  Very Comfortable room Staff very good and excellent location Always stay here ,1
No Negative Fantastic location Loved the rooftop pool area Very comfy beds ,1
 The room was very dated and needed a lot of refurbishing The window was cracked and overlooked a very ugly sight In order to shut the door completely you had to actually slam it The walls were so thin that we could hear our neighbors quite loudly all night long There were not enough usable outlets in the room and the lighting was very poor  Location is great ,0
 Not sure if we had the right rooms One room had no windows although fairly roomy The other had no wardrobe and the bed could only be accessed from one side and both rooms were called de luxe  Staff very friendly helpful Decor great ,0
"I've stayed at this hotel many times before and it never fails to impress me how it copes with so many guests checking in at once, and the staff being so friendly. There is a beautiful lounge area to the right of Reception, which looks like a Gentleman's club with fireplace and comfy seats.
The rooms are large and well decorated with upper rooms having wonderful views over Seattle.
The hotel is central to all the shops and a beautiful walk to Pike Market and all its excellent eateries nearby.
Nothing is too much trouble for the hotel staff and I would recommend the hotel to both business travellers and families.",1
No Negative very friendly staff ,1

"The room is clean but the bathroom is extremely old and the tub-shower kind of disgusting. The room has a view of a brick wall. There is no room service menu, no channel line-up for the updated but small TV. The wi-fi is not working. There are no extra blankets, no cozy bathrobe, and no coffee maker!!!! You have to ask for anything you might want which to me, goes against everything a good, expensive hotel should stand for. I travel often and am staying here because a conference I am attending is here. I would not stay here again, nor reccommend to a friend. Stay at the W. Better service. Bigger, more updated rooms, and they do everything they can to please. You feel like another number ha the New Yorker. A number that they want to deal with as little as possible.",0
 TV did not work and had to be replaced Room was peaceful,1
 The location wasn t the best The food looked as though it had been lying around for quite a time so we didn t eat in the hotel  The rooms were clean and comfortable OK for a couple of nights but no space so wouldn t be good for a longer stay ,0
 they should include free breakfast with the stay like other 4 star hotels do for the same price  Staff was very helpful room was clean and wifi was excellent Will come again ,1

"I am a Hilton Diamond Member and usually love most Hiltons. This one did not measure up! The lobby is utlitarian and has many obviously non-hotel guests sitting around. The service was attentive and pleasant, but cannot overcome the negatives. One A Tower elevator was out of commission for more than a day, and a foul odor was present around it. There is no lounge (we were told that this was for our convenience!!!!). The breakfast lineup at Starbucks was -- minutes, the sit down restaurant longer. Rooms - blah. By the way, location is NOT on Union Square - it is several blocks, and many homeless panhandlers, away.",0
 In our particular room the shower wasn t high on the wall rather it was best to sit in the bath to use the shower nozzle  Lovely big bed though rather firm Good pillows Very quiet and nice and dark when sleeping Plenty of toiletries 24 hour reception with nice helpful staff with good english Close to plenty of shops and restaurants and a short walk to the main duomo ,1
 Shower had a low ceiling room had no window Shower was also only luke warm in the morning Breakfast was over priced so didnt bother Staff said there was nowhere to get food after midnight so i walked outside and walked 30 seconds and bought hot food corridors are like rabbit warrens  King size bed was nice and large room was modern had green tea ,0

 All good Great staff,1
I just want to say this has been the best hotel that I have stayed in. The breakfast was wonderful and the front desk personel was ALWAYS friendly and helpful. We were on our wedding anniversary and had a fabulous time. I LOVE that is was smoke free. The beds were comfortable and was close to places to eat. Desiree at the front dest always asked us how we were doing and was so helpful. When you have friendly staff it makes for a much better stay. I would definately recommend this hotel on your next stay. We will be definately coming back. Loved the hot tub too. I give this hotel -- stars!!,1
 The showerhead and shower were difficult to position to keep water from spraying on the floor The foot of the bed was too close to the wall making it difficult to get to the other side of the room  The staff were very helpful in finding us places to eat and providing directions to places we wanted to visit in addition to being very friendly The room decor and hotel were gorgeous so perfect for Paris And the bathroom was surprisingly spacious ,1
 Room small for the price paid and no kettle would have expected one for the price  Reasonable breakfast and friendly staff,0

 The room next door was extremely loud they might as well have been sat in my room They were loud till 2am so no sleep and there s no sound proofing in the rooms I booked 2 rooms a standard one for my son and an executive room The rooms were both very small Could do with some rules on keeping the noise down after a certain time at night and also maybe a bar area downstairs that s open in the evening to encourage people to have a little drink down in the bar rather than in their rooms  The staff were friendly Close to all amenities in Earls Court Close to tube station Breakfast was adequate Good for a quick over night stay ,0
 Breakfast was poor Staff at breakfast was awe full others were fine My room was next to reception so it was a bit noisy I was never able to shower It was either boiling or freezing No pork items on breakfast which is almost a must for visitors into the UK,0
"We stayed one night at Hilton Fort Worth after bOoking through hotwire - and were very happy with our stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, lovely beds, great, large bathroom with excellent shower, and large flat screen tvs.

"First off the door has a vent that you can open and close and mine didn't close second! The restroom vent was broken also. But that's ok things break. The deal breaker was the highway noise! Highway noise is tolerable when cars aren't hotrodding along the feeder road like they were all night at this location. But then there were also - guys standing outside my room all night with a dog. And peaple walked by every - minutes all night long. And there were kids outside till all hours.
It was miserable and I promise to never stay at another motel - again as long as places which could be repaired and watched are taken care of.stay away if you need sleep.",0

"Our room was completely disgusting. The bed skirt was ripped and hanging off the bed, one side had a huge white stain down the side of it as if some one had thrown up. The sheets had stains on them. Their was a red stain on the dresser by the tv, maybe wine or blood. Scary area to walk around. Left after one night, the girl at the front desk did nothing after I told her the next morning. Could not believe they charged -- dollars for this nightmare, Paid -- dollars at a red roof inn that was clean and half the price!",0
 The service at breakfast wasn t very good the staff sat us down and didn t explain How the breakfast worked we wasn t offered tea or coffee we sat down wondering if we could just go up to the buffet or if we had to wait for a waitress we then had to get someone attention to get a tea and coffee We loved the location of the hotel we think we would of struggled to get to the hotel if we didn t have the use of the ferry so this is very convenient,1

 The hotel allows non residents to pay to use the facilities which included stag parties It is basically a conference hotel so as individual travellers we felt pretty unimportant particularly when the deck area we preferred was closed off for a private function On 2 days our room was not serviced when we returned at the end of the day Overall not the experience we expected for the 5 star price we were paying  Staff were generally very good particularly the deck team who tried hard to improve our stay after we shared our concerns,0
 The windows cannot be opened It would ve been great if the windows can be slightly opened to get fresh breeze Amazing hotel staff and location,1
"This was a rare disappointment with Hampton Inn. My room was dark and dingy with a ugly carpet that needed replacement. The TV was inferior quality and the bed was ok, but no more. Bathroom was clean but small. Breakfast was typical Hampton. I would give it three stars except it was quite expensive. If you have to stay in the wilderness that is the Denver Airport area, there are probably better places to be had for the money.",0

"I've stayed here twice. Once for a personal vacation and once for a business convention. Both times I was treated rudely. The first time, they didn't even have my reservation, but I had the confirmation from the hotel so they had to give me a room. Wonderful. I got a handicap room which was supposedly non-smoking, but obviously not. Also, we had our car parked but were not informed of a charge for this until we checked out. The second time I had a better room, bt the wait at the front desk for anything was outrageous. There was never anyone at the concierge desk. And my co-worker called down to have tissues sent to her room (they are provided in the bathroom) but was told they don't have any!Dont' stay here.

 My last two or three stays standards have dropped compared to other hotels in London mainly the facilities regarding the rooms rather than the rest of hotel The last stay I had a room which directly outside workers were in the middle of laying new carpets this left the whole area smelling of glue throughout my 2 night stay the cost was iro 760 gbp for 2 nights so value for money it was appauling I stay there a lot as victoria london location is great for my work trips also I m member of the hotel group points scheme,0

"I didn't know what to expect when last-minute booking this hotel - clearly the property has been around for a while. But they have done a nice renovation, and the amenities are up to date with current expectations. Check in was a breeze (at almost midnight,) and after a long day, there were still dining options available nearby. Another bonus for ATT customers is the attwifi. All in all, a pleasant stay.",1

"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire for the last couple nights and I would recommend visitors avoid the hotel.
The location is fine. It's within two blocks of the subway. The neighborhood is nice too.
But... the bathroom was a wreck. There were piles of dirt swept into the corners and just left (the broom too). The towel rack had been snapped in the middle and left. Even the shower itself hadn't been fully cleaned.
They also failed to clean up the vomit -hrs after it sat on the carpet on Fl.-.
It was a busy weekend in NYC. Hotels were booked. And unfortunately, hotels like Belleclaire just take advantage of the situation. I would recommend you find another hotel.",0
"My friends and I found Fashion -- to be very innovative, stylish and a perfect complement to the Fashion District. Great thought and creativity went into every facet of its design.
It is in a convenient, busy location right off -th Ave., yet rooms are perfectly quiet & restful.

 The size of the room that we paid for seemed very small for the money  The staff were very friendly and helpful The Hotel was very clean and comfortable The Hotel was well situated for sightseeing ,1
 The distance from the station with no bus that goes past Like everyone else the fact that you have to pay for a shuttle which only goes once an hour Surely after so many moans they could offer it more often and free for the price you pay per room Also no plug near the mirror for hairdriers Too far out of town with no easy way to get back after 12 15 The shower in the room Quirky and the drinks prices ,0
"Was here for a conference. The first day I asked at the desk for directions to the conference and the woman really just made something up. Directed me to a totally wrong building. Bizarre. 
Then I had a package delivered to me and they charged me -- dollars for handling and storage. 
The restaurant and patio are gorgeous but the music is such godawful Muzak that I just left and went somewhere else for lunch. 
And as a matter of policy I always dock one additional star for places that charge for wifi. Three days = $--! 
It is close to the zoo and the neighborhood is sort of cute. Otherwise give it a pass.",0

"Stayed at The Westin the weekend of ---- & -------. I booked online through the hotel's web site for $--- a night. The hotel was fabulous. The room was very large, quiet and with modern decor. Everything in the hotel and room appear to be brand new. The service was excellent. Room service was quick and very good. The hotel restaurant, Shula's Steakhouse was equally first class. I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel and my stay. Having stayed at other Times Square hotels, I would only use the Westin in the future.",1
 Nithing All round top class experience,1
"As a San Diego native and resident, I have seen a lot of hotels in San Diego and finally got to spend some time in Paradise Point. I have always been impressed with the lush landscaping and during Christmas when the lights and christmas tree are up, it is delightful. 
However, the rooms are very dated. This means you get an older squeaky wooden bed, old furniture, a small TV and old bathroom fixtures (and the place smells). My wife and I both agreed that the room was reminiscent of those motels one stays in when traveling across the country. 
The landscaping is nice, always has been. But thats about it. 
Since our room was paid for as we were attending a company retreat, we had no problem returning to our condo at nights.
If you love motels, this is an expensive one you just might like.",0
 This hotel property is located in a suburb of Milan about a 30 minute trolley car ride to the city center For the d cor location and services provided I thought it was a bit pricey If I was rating it by German hotel standards I would put it somewhere between standard and first class that is about 3 5 stars  Very friendly helpful and professional staff,0

 This is really not suitable for business trip as the rooms are very loud and I couldn t sleep the whole night The bed was not comfortable Even though I had a room on the 6th floor the windows were small that made the room quite depressing to stay in Check in took too long The hotel restaurant seems really good but not appropriate for room service unless you are in the mood for 3 or 6 course surprise menu The room was clean Check out was fast,0

My husband and I were travelling with our - year old daughter and - year old son - we felt very welcome and the staff was extremely accomodating. Shuttle service to the airport was our primary concern; they got us to the airport in a timely manner, with shuttle service running from very early in the morning. Shuttles were clean, drivers were friendly, and helpful with all our baggage (luggage, stroller, carseat) - excellent service with a smile!",1

"We stayed at this hotel - which should not be called a hotel, rather a hostel - in January for - nights. It was a DUMP!!! In - nights we had to change rooms - times! The heater system was making a loud & clanky noise which prohibited any sleep whatsoever. The hotel was tacky, seedy, dirty, riddled with bed bugs & the entire staff were incompetent. In my opinion this place should not be operating - it needs to be pulled down and or some serious renovations need to take place.",0

First off i get to the hotel around --AM to check in and reception rudely tells me """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""its too early, come back later!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so i then asked if i can leave my bags and the man rang a bell and pointed at the wall. When i finally returned to get my room i was SHOCKED at the size!!! It was the size of a pantry oh & forget a bathroom, you have to walk down the hall for that luxury. When i went to reception luckily i was greated by a friendly young man who understood my situation and was able to upgrade (with a fee) to a more suitable room with a BATHROOM.

 Smell Comfy bed,1
 It s not as close to the center as we expected it to be and the area around it is not that cool but at least the tram station is right in front Still it doesn t seem like a 4 star hotel more like 3 stars it s very small and right by a busy street So it s good if you just want a nice and clean little place to stay for a couple days but not if you re looking for something more fancy  They had soy desserts for breakfast which was awesome for me since I can t have milk and the rest of the food was good too but not that many choices The shower in our room was huge and really nice once you had figured out how to close it properly though ,0
No Negative Nice location 1 minute away from the station Close the door when having a shower alarm is sensitive,1
 A bit expensive compared to other hotels locally Easy parking Friendly staff Close to great restaurants at Darsena ,1
 Deciding not to partake of breakfast I attempted to return my 10 breakfast voucher Informed by the Manager that this is non fundable He was happy to loose my custom given the 433 00 bill I had just settled in favour of not refunding the 10 breakfast voucher Clearly not a customer focused facility  Good selection of restaurants the Indian serves particularly good food ,0
 Had a hotel staff follow me and question me like I was not suppose to be there Almost was yelling with him as he didn t believe I was staying there till I pulled out my key Is this how they treat all their guests No Positive,0
 Bathroom a little too basic No paper tissues minimum of soap and shampoo  Very easy to get to Metro station right in front of Hotel Very friendly and helpful staff ,1
"Stayed at the Royal Palms for the Lamborghini Giro and was quite disappointed mainly because of high expectations. The room and service were both mediocre for a hotel of this caliber.... Returning to Scottsdale, I would definitely stay at Sanctuary or Hyatt Gainey Ranch which are both superior in every regard. The only bright spot to the stay was the food, both dinner and breakfast at T. Cooks. Otherwise, I certainly couldn't tell you why others regard this as the best hotel in Scottsdale - Maybe, they've never stayed in a Casita at Sanctuary?!?",0
No Negative Great location Clean comfortable and quiet room Friendly and helpful staff ,1
 Would have been even nicer if a cooked buffet style breakfast had been available as an extra cost option  Quality feel in both rooms and public areas for an attractive price Good location in a nice part of Bayswater Quiet location for an urban area Close to the Underground and a good selection of restaurants ,1
 Smell in the room 772 due to the leackage from Aircondition No compliments for caused inconveniences We complained ones Housekeeper just put towel on the floor howeve smell oixisted the whole stay This is unacceptable Internet is very poor in our room  Liked apples in Lobby and fresh water Appreciated ,0

"Located in the heart of Manhattan, I spent there three nights! I had a water damage in the very early morning (- a.m.) and the only reaction of the hotel staff was to bring some towel and put a drying machine in the room, which was really loud, so I unplugged it, when I was in the room! Never again",0
 The room service pizza was terrible Actually was the worst pizza I ve ever eaten  The room with patio was the reason I chose this hotel Ideal for a smoker,1

 To be very honest the staff in the pub were not that helpful we arrived at 1 30 pm and as per the website we knew we could not check in until 3pm which was ok but we just had to leave our bags unattended behind the bar when I though a locked room would of not been to much to ask with a very very late check in time and after receiving an email to say the lift was out of order we were directed up three very twisty stair cases to the top floor without even a mention with help with our bags finally the room did smell damp but was over all clean  Location was great and price was ok for the area,0
 The housekeeping and cleanileness is zero The service is below average for a 5 star hotel There are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed The furniture is really old compared to what I saw on the website Not child friendly at all wifi was bad No Positive,0
 While the hotel s Soho location is great for nightlife and dining the hotel itself happens to be located on a somewhat dimly lit side street which might make some people a little nervous at night  Our room was comfortable and well appointed The front desk staff was very welcoming and helpful and we really appreciated the complimentary bottle of champagne and hand written note they had waiting in our room after finding out we were celebrating our wedding anniversary ,1
 it was very cold as we were on the bottom floor and the room took a long time to even heat up a little there were heaters provided but it still took a while the bathroom was nice and spacious and had a very big bath the hotel was cute and small but just what we needed ,0

 Far from the central and there no restaurant around  The place was very quiet and the rooms are big and very comfy,0
 Restaurant is convenient but very average  Staff was very helpful ,0

 the fact that the room was much smaller than the website photos pretended general atmosphere,0
No Negative Excellent breakfast comfortable and well maintained rooms and communal areas ,1
 The single room was really small It looked like a cupboard transformed into a room The room was very warm and you could hear the noise from the other rooms  The location of the hotel is excellent,0
 These are not deal breakers but some things that maybe other travelers would like to know Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet having said all that we got by just fine I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair  Location is beyond fabulous View from our 4th floor room was incredible Parking is not a problem Being able to fall asleep at night to the sound of the ocean is a must for everyone ,1
 price quality breakfast is overpriced food was not tasty coffee was the worst we had in Vienna staff seems to be tensed and is not really hospitable food in the restaurant was also very dissapointing dust smell in the rooms linen and the towels are to be refreshed  beautiful perfect Location city park in front of the hotel very professional staff at the reception desk comfortable bedding spacious room and the bathroom standard services and amenities,0
 Too expensive for nothing I have been to 4 star hotels and its way better than this First night I got bitten by a weird bug in my bed and my foot still swollen and Itchy They do not clean the rooms no vacume no antiseptic product use none of it I realized that they do not change your mugs they wash it quick in the sink Too over priced and not justified kinda waste of money Breakfast is around 30 euros per person and its below average Location is perfect since its in Dam sqaure but thats it Never again in that hotel  Location Only ,0
 Staff at reception on 2 occasions were rude abrupt elder gentleman at check in appeared to be annoyed that we didn t want the hotel breakfast at 31 euro per person and also showed notable annoyance that we didn t accept the advance charge of 70 euro per night for mini bar incase we wanted to use it and then found the mini bar to be electronically locked once we reached our room No free wifi in rooms  Location was good Within walking distance of main attractions and near transport links Rooms large but as with any large corporate chain rooms are characterless ,0
"I recently booked a room for some friends—a one-night stay wedding gift spent on their first anniversary—and could not be happier. Booking was super easy and working with the concierge even easier. The folks at the Royalton were gracious and went above and beyond to make the night special for my friends who reported that they did, indeed, have a wonderful night. The room was sexy and all set up with champagne, rose petals—the works! I can't wait to go myself sometime soon!",1
 The noise outside plus the smell of the kitchen The stuff were awesome,1
 An English speaking television would be really good  We had a beautifully decorate room and although is faced the street was very quiet Breakfast was good and the staff really very helpful they seemed to enjoy their work ,1

No Negative Nice quiet room with bottled water and breakfast was good too Very close to royal Albert hall which was perfect for our stay and Hyde park for winter wonderland,1
 Everything from the staff to the carpets Staff were slow and very unhelpful The room was very dirty and the air con was very noisy The room looked the complete opposite to the picture show on your website therefore i will not be recommending anyone to use your site and I will not be using your website to book anything ever again Which is ashame because I usually use your website whenever I stay out somewhere I will be leaving a review on your site and all your social media account in the next few days I would hate for it to happen to someone else Bed was comfy Good location,0
 the air felt stuffy and the lights and d cor were too dark executive lounge was the best facility it was excellent Food was delicious,1

 Rooms were a little dusty in places noticed on the phones there was a layer of dust on it that could have been picked up There was a odd sewage smell from the pipes in our room when we came back in the evening it soon passed and didn t effect our stay but it s worth noting that they should have picked it up before we did  Swiming pool food and staff service was brilliant ,1

"Our flight was delayed into Denver and we called for transfer services at -:-- am. Told by D... at the front desk that we would have to wait forty minutes. It was how he spoke not only to me but a business man who had already phoned for pick-up. When the driver finally arrived, I inquired the distance to the hotel and was asked, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""You got a problem""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""? Thinking that I misunderstood him, I asked the same question two more times. I finally learned that the Crowne Plaza Denver International hotel is actually -- miles from the airport. At that point, since I did not know where we were going and we had a beligerent employee. I said no more. Clients should not have to feel intiminated and concerned for their safety.",0
"was there on a Friday night for one night and they put me in a king room directly opposite the pool. The room was clean and well attended with toiletries and proper towns and linens.
The bed was a nice pillowtop that was very comfortable. I guess being really tired had a lot to do with the great sleep I had there.
The traffic in the area is extremely busy, but it is very accessable to I -- but you have to watch the exits, its at ---B but going northbound you have to exit the Bowden Road exit to get to it. It can be confusing.
Overall, nothing special, but then again its not a five star",0
 Shower isn t high enough for tall people to get under Great room bed location Friendly and helpful staff,1
 It was a very big disappointment The staff tried There wasn t even a place to put your luggage No luggage rack The shower had no door or curtain The water ran on the floor There was no miirror in bathroom which was tiny and no place to put anything  It was 550 for a hotel like Days Inn but not as good 2 days at a very poor hotel ,0

Really nice hotel. Very quiet. Courteous helpful staff. Enjoyed our meals in the dining room overlooking the marina. Nice area to take walks. Only downside was the pillows on the bed. They were very lumpy and not comfortable. Would stay again there,1
 I was given a room in the basement That s right At the rate of nearly 200 pounds a night I had basically no windows the only window was facing a wall a few feet away was next to the gym and had to listen to people walking up and down the hallway all night likely employees of the hotel who were obviously working On top of that I woke up to the smell of breakfast food in my room While I love breakfast the smell was so strong and pervasive that I couldn t enjoy it and grew increasingly frustrated for the absence of fresh odorless air  The location is very convenient right next to Hyde Park and a couple of underground stations ,0
 Expensive 30 each for breakfast We were upgraded butvto a room next to the lift Lots of noisy adults partying in corridors until 3 am Great venue,0
No Negative The hotel was spotless and room was so quiet and the bed was so comfy excellent sleep ,1

 My mother fell down in the in balmes street at 11 45 pm and she had a pain and edema in her ankle When we arrived at hotel I asked for staff if i could have some ice cube to put on her ankle For my surprise the staff told us that they did not have ice in the hotel there is a bar restaurant inside of hotel and suggested to buy in supermarket across from the hotel Sad  Good Location,0

"While a bit dated, the Westin Philadelphia is a beautiful hotel, with dark wood paneling and chandeliers throughout. However, the staff does not like their chosen line of work that much. I had to harass the concierge for a small request (to find a jazz club for that night). The room was not particularly clean either (spots on the carpet, etc.) During my next stay in Philadelphia, I think I'll try the Sofitel. My wife and I wandered in for breakfast and it looked much more promising.",0
 Superior room no different to normal double Rooms small Not very good lighting Breakfast only included with superior room Location excellent,1
 The rooftop bar was closed when we went Food was a tad pricey The room was lovely and 24 hour concierge too Lovely layout ,1

"You know this hotel is going to be something special the second you pull up to it. 
The rooms are absolutely huge and amazing. Everything from the random vinyl records to the couches, kitchen, and the bathrooms are done with a funky & upbeat style of class.

"Where do I begin. I was a bit nervous when reading the more recent reviews, but boy was I wrong. The hotel was amazing in ALL aspects. They treated us like family right when we walked in, from the Bell men to the front desk. We stayed there for - nights from the -th of September. Our room was nice, nothing amazing, but the bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean. The service is TOP notch. The Istana restaurant was spectacular every morning. The hostess was very nice, and Foudi took care of us with his amazing crew. After the first day they knew exactly what we wanted and took care of us as they saw us approaching the restaurant. The housekeeping staff was on point...left extra towels and maintained the room perfectly. This is our new home when visiting New York....",1
"The hotel is situated right in the heart of the historic district, close to all attractions. Our room was good for the two nights we stayed there but had we stayed for any length of time then the room would be a little cramped. The room and bathroom was clean to a high standard. The breakfasts were sufficient - continental - mainly breads, yogurts, muffins but there was also a waffle maker and an omelette maker (omelettes pre-packed). The staff were very helpful and efficient. We did get quite a lot of street noise on the first night - Saturday. Sunday was much quieter.",1

"Got a suite here to invite a few friends and party because I was moving away. Didn't really see much of the hotel other then the suite. Suite had a bedroom, separate living room and huge bathroom. Everything was furnished very nicely. The hotel staff was great in bringing up extra chairs and glasses. The party did get a little loud and the hotel staff gave us a few warnings but we managed to make it through the night without any huge issues. I don't have much else to say about the hotel. Its a Ritz and its nice and I would stay here again if I wanted to party like a rockstar again.",0

 The room is quite small as everywhere else in Paris People yelling in the street at 11 pm the hotel is in front of the Olympia s back door is not very pleasant even though it is out of the hotel s control The room service came twice in the afternoon and entered the room for no apparent reason and retreated immediately after realizing I was there It doesn t feel safe  The bed is very confortable Very pleasant stay ,1

 We booked 2 rooms with friends our friend had the room closest the the DLR no view and noisy We had a disabled room which we did not request the bathroom was not clean and very tired smelt of drains and right opposite the lift Honestly I think we got the worst 2 rooms in the hotel and it was a special weekend away We could have stayed somewhere else and paid less and got better rooms  Breakfast,0
 Room size  modern and clean Pleasant staff Good location ,1
 Breakfast could have been included The staff were great,1
 More space Good experience over priced in my opinion much like other London Hotels ,1
 there was nothing to dislike We knew that the rooms were small b4 we booked Breakfast was good value with good availability until late into the session staff were helpful elevator worked everytime we will use Mercure again next time we are in London,1
 Front door entrance looks tired Some people might not enter  Super clean Staff exceptionally courteous ,1
 Took 3 calls to get a bottle of water in the room No hairdryer had to call for that too Service slow at breakfast and tables not cleaned automaticallyNo Positive,1
 The location is easily accessible but the main road is a typical big modern road with not so many beautiful things to see Hotel is situated just off the main road so not bothered by the noice  Had a lovely stay here Staff helpful and friendly and always willing to help advice Breakfast lovely with lots of fresh fruit bread juices meats etc etc The toiletries provided are of great quality and I was pleased to see there was the usual soap shampoo conditioner shower gel body lotion and also hand cream Wifi was free and worked really well And the location of the hotel was easy to reach with a number of Metro lines but being situated on a smaller side road off the main boulevard one couldn t hear all the busy traffic Would happily stay here again ,1
 The breakfast was not included in a the room rate and was very expensive They keep the snacks in tea tray and it seems complimentary and nothing was mentioned on it whereas minibar was separate Upon checking out they charged us another 20 For using those snacks  Staff at reception was very helpful and accommodating Location was also good on a calm and peaceful street with Just 2 minutes walk to Porte Malliot Station from where you can go anywhere In the city shanzay Lezay was also a 10 minute walk and very easily accessible ,1
 The whole hotel is really old I think they need a renovation really soon I wouldn t go back to this hotel The hall is big and is a good place to work or have a fast meeting for business purposes The pool area is old but still good to have it,0
"Staff friendly and professional. But rooms have deteriorated substantially from my stay last year. Dirty carpets, non-functional fixtures, peeling paint, wallpaper and stained tile equals intentional poor maintenance. I asked for different room and it was worse....all that luxury for $----night.
I would strongly urge readers to steer clear of this hotel until they realize how badly theur reputation becomes when they don't maintain quality of the rooms",0
"true historic hotel in every sense,fabulous. staff great,Eliazabeth,is perfect for helping with food.rooms large and airy,area outside is a joy,stayed for red steagull weekend,it was unreal !!
thank you !!",1
 The room we were given had no natural light at all It felt like we were staying in a dungeon Breakfast was very overpriced There was little choice for people having to avoid gluten in their diet The hotel is poor compared to what it was like just a couple of years ago Having stayed at The Wesley a number of times in the past when it was a much better offer we ve decided to stay elsewhere on our visits to London from now on No Positive,0

 Pls improve the level of interior design of your old style hotel  The location which is very close to everything everything,1
We stayed at the Sheraton for one night. We had heard that the rooms were small and were surprised to find a nice sized double queen room. The rooms were clean and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Some negatives were the handle on bathroom door was falling off and the cost of parking was ridiculous. The day we left there were at least -- people waiting for thier car. If you were in a hurry to get anywhere you would be out of luck. Recomend parking across the streat. The bakery attached was slow at getting us what we ordered. I would like to give it two ratings if I could. - for service and - for quality of room.,0
 Shower in the room was hopeless Lift broke whilst in it Too expensive for the stay  Jacuzzi was really nice ,0
 min 30 min walk to the port and 45 to La Rambla near the beach clean modern hotel good choice for breakfast,0
 The cleanliness is is below average You can not let it bother you if you are not spending much time in the hotel The bed feels old and one side was sunken in and the room feels very dusty The toilet seems newly renovated but the shower system is not user friendly Most of the facilities in the room were worn out and very very in need of replacement  The location is really the best Just 2 minutes walk to all the shopping in Oxford circus Staff were nice and helpful and generally no big issues with the hotel Price was really awesome for the location in summer ,0
No Negative Beautiful hotel The staff here are extremely friendly polite and helpful The breakfast was very pleasant with the best croissants The beds were super comfy as were the pillows Just what was needed after a long day trekking the streets of Paris The hotel is in a perfect location to get around on either foot or by the metro ,1
 Pool could be warmer Conditioner in room changing room Night light for bathroom Perhaps provide bins on floors for guests to leave rubbish  Location Location location Pool great addition Staff friendly Fridge in room Wifi 55 tv Water replenished daily Able to extend stay for good price ,1
 Getting across the road via tunnel from tube to hotel The staff very attentive excellent choice and quality of breakfast,1
 The room was on the smallish side but that was to be expected for a Parisian hotel Also some might find the walls a bit thin there were times in the middle of the night or early morning when we could hear the plumbing from an adjacent room and even the murmur of another television set However it was not too bothersome and again for Paris we expected tight spaces  This hotel was beautiful and the room looked even better in real life than in the photos The room was very nicely appointed and felt luxe for the relatively reasonable price and unbeatable location very short walk to the metro and many restaurants and shops nearby The shower was amazing with very good water pressure and the bed was comfy Would gladly stay here again ,1
 I have nothing against  Good location nice crew comfortable and clean room ,1
 Noise from the building next door Starts at 10pm till 6am Friday and Saturday Loud Music Had to leave the hotel a day early Staff not really interested in sorting the problem out I did get a refund on the night i didnt stay for  Fridge in Room,0
 Internet conexion Size and quality of the furniture of the room,1
 The room was quite small and on the 1st floor overlooking the building renovations of the building across the road The noise started early in the morning The cost of water in the room is 3 Ridiculously overpriced In most hotels this would be free The lifts are very slow small and cramped  The welcome to the hotel was great Very friendly staff Easy to get a taxi in the morning Very good location ,0
 The bed is a little bit too stiff  Clean Staff are nice ,0
 the room is quite cramped and it took me 10 minutes to figure out how to shut the blinds using the iPad the battery on the iPad was poor so you had to leave it in the holster and it was quite buggy the view was great check in was easy and the bar on the top floor is cool,1
 Very expensive not good bad Good location,0
 Nothing Good hotel decent location close to tube and friendly staff,1
 Apartment suitable for 2 couples but not for more people Sofa bed in very tiny lounge room kitchen There was no dining room table so we couldn t eat in the apartment  Very good location friendly and helpful staff ,0
 Small bed Beautiful hotel in historic location ,1
 Reception slow and male staff grumpy Failed to clean room one day but someone had been in room to put clean towels in and removed pl clean my room notice Rang reception and was told only clean every other day So had to make own bed and only 1 tea bag Complained when checked out and was told only changed sheets every other day so was given wrong info Was offered a voucher for better room if we came again But don t intend to visit Amsterdam again  Spacious quiet room comfy bed,0
 The breakfast was very poor I went first day but it was not good at all and didn t go again It is central,0

 Left do not disturb sign on door door knocked on twice Bed was comfortable breakfast delicio,1
No Negative We were just staying there for one night Perfect location in Paris Clean rooms comfort bed Have to say that this hotel has one of the best showers ,1
No Negative The service provided by the staff So welcoming especially a girl named Angela at the front desk The rooms were spacious and very clean with top class facilities minor details that embedded a really touch their hotel and guests ,1
 While the staff at the counter was friendly the bell hop was reasonably rude when asked any question The pictures online made the hotel seem a bit more updated but the room wasn t even close to new It was banged up at best and is in dire need of a renovation The hairdryer was a box on the wall with a nozzle The amenities were minimal and it was really worn like a time warp but not a good one  The location of this hotel was conveniently located across from the train station and easily accessible to other train stations as well ,0
 I thought the food was a bit pricey  The bed was very comfortable and the staff were very warm and welcoming ,1
 Massive gap under the door you could hear everything in the hallway Had to plug the kettle in on the floor as there were no plug sockets where the tea station was The bathroom was below average for the price And my boyfriend wanted to surprise me for my graduation with decorations which he paid for But the decorations said happy anniversary  Comfy bed,0
 Hotel could do with modernising and a lick of paint The bed was uncomfortable and the walls in the rooms were paper thin so you can hear other guests conversations  Location was excellent especially if you are seeing a show and the breakfast was good ,0
 This definitely was NOT a 4 star hotel It was not even comparable to the 3 star in Venice we stayed There was essentially no air conditioning It was so hot in the room we sweated the whole time and it was hard to sleep To top off the hot room the shower drain was broken and plugged up so we had to wait for the water levels to go down to finish a shower and before the next person could go There was no laundry service on the weekend which we didn t find out about until after we got it all bagged up There was no ice This was a miserable experience  The memory foam pillows,0
 All in general Location quiet close to the Main Street and restaurants and shops also nice and friendly staff,1
 At first a room was given that was lower standard from what had been reserved small bed no noise insulation from the noisy road etc Finding this out at 23 30 arguing with reception and moving things at that time of night was not great We were lucky there was a nice available room and night staff were helpful So the experience turned back being more positive  Once brought into a good room experience turned positive,0
 There was a problem with the hairdryer in our room The hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror Just a minor detail really but a bit annoying  The hotel was great The rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly Our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean Drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive The hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes ,1
No Negative Lovely room v comfy bed and huge bath ,1
 Spider web in the room corners stained carpet dirty bathroom very uncomfortable bed no heating central heating wasn t working at all Single glazed window really noisy constant knocking noise all night from central heating pipes from other floors Damp smell moths in the corner of the carpets in the room power sockets are all damaged hot water only comes after running the taps for 3 4 minutes half used shampoo bottle left behind in the bathroom bedside lamp stands broken woken up by breakfast team noise than other guest noises at 7 30am Basement room lg2 should not be sold for money This was definitely a worth 85 a night hotel Next time I will spend that money to get a taxi home Very disappointing Felt ripped off  Towels clean and nice quality,0
 Air conditioning was horrible location was terrible elevators old and slow as a conclusion it wasn t like a 4star hotel Room size parking cleaning,0
No Negative Great location to everything Friendly helpful staff Junior Suite was spacious and very quiet ,1
 Charged us extra 50 for kids upon check in couldn t cancel our reservation upon checking in so forced to pay and stay because we were too tired after a long flight with kids We wished we were staying at Glam Milan It is more conveniently located looked nice from outside Not accessible with luggages and strollers so this poor assigned staff has to help guest with carrying their items Facility itself is less than impressive upon first view and our room was dust though we had to stay for them to get it ready Reception staff fast and business like and not welcoming at all  Location is close to central train station,0
 The bars the room was not worth the money for what i paid Room wasnt cleaned enough etc  Location ,0

 No free WiFi in the room for the price that you pay for it No Positive,0
 Please remove the charge for the internet You have to pay 10 euros for the internet 10 euros For a five star hotel that caters for business people we couldn t believe you have to pay extra for the internet in 2016  My adult children and I stayed at the Hilton and were excited by the prospect a 5 star hotel in Vienna perfect Unfortunately we were disappointed ,0
 the pool was terrible surroundings were like a war zone pool was 3 ft deep everything was a taxi ride  the staff was very freindly,0
 The room was atiny very basic hostel like I had to drag my bag up a stairs The carpet was worn I have never stayed in such a hole before No Positive,0
 Aircon was not functioning but they provided us with electric fan  The hotel is in a safe place and almost in front of the Police Station They changed the reception to have better interaction with guests You can view the lighted Eiffel Tower from their 7th floor at night My room has free minibar The room has bluetooth speaker Ms Laurence at the front desk is very accommodating and helpful It made outstay in the hotel more personal Very near the Metro train and bus station groceries and pharmacy Strong unlimited wifi Good soundproofing,1
 Bathroom was small sink was blocked and the fan didn t work Breakfast room was cramped very small without much room at all Food was okay but you had to serve yourself and wait for some as it wasn t always ready on the plates so other food got cold on your plate Too many people with just one person giving help Had to ask three times for some tea three times for a glass to put some juice in and it felt as if you were a problem In all it wasn t worth the money A small over crowded place without room to swing a cat I won t go there again  The bed was comfortable,0
 We got the rooms very late The executive rooms were very small and we didn t have a place to work The rooms were very old No Positive,0
 Room very small Great hotel Fantastic location Staff very helpful All is good,1
 This review is specific for classic room which we booked The room was very small and felt cramped There was water blockage in shower and it was so small you couldn t move properly The staff was always missing from reception desk and nobody picked up our calls We didn t enjoy our stay at the hotel The only good thing about the hotel is its location but then again that can be said about other hotels in the vicinity and chances are they will be far better than this on winter terms of facilities Avoid No Positive,0

 Restaurant not open at weekends some restaurants near by but not a massive choice after a full day of sight seeing would have been nice to be able to eat at the hotel Would stop me staying again at a weekend  Hotel very friendly staff excellent breakfast rooms nice and clean,1

No Negative The hotel is very grand and feels like a luxurious place to stay Each service interaction was good and I felt like a valued guest ,1
"My wife and I had prepaid for two nights and after the first we gave up and moved out. What a dump, I can not believe they had such dirty carpets and threadbare linen, on the bed, they even had holes in them. To be honest, until they completely remodel the place I would not recommend anyone staying there. We didn't even care we had to pay again at a different hotel. Just as long as we were not staying there.",0
 Be aware the rooms are fun unique but small m so make sure you like the person you are travelling with  Atmosphere in lobby and Lounge great place to hang and meet friends ,1
"I have stayed here several times, and this is absolutely my favorite place to stay in Boston. It's expensive -- but worth it, especially for a room overlooking the harbor. Ask for this view and you will not be disappointed. Rooms are comfortable and very nicely appointed. Service is usually very nice if not over-the-top; can be a little stand-offish, but not consistently so. Spa is lovely. Outdoor restaurant terrace right on harbor is lovely in nice weather - another """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""favorite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" spot in Boston for me. Inside bar-lounge is cozy in poor weather. I even love the lobby furniture. 
Very close to Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, South Station and Aquarium and just a short walk (or fast cab ride) to Back Bay, Newbury Street, South End, etc.",1
"We stayed for - nights in the - room suite. Comfortable rooms, bathroom is very small, loved the Greek restaurant across the street and the market around the corner. Safe neighborhood close to Central Park. Would stay again, reasonable for a family of four.",0

No Negative Spacious rooms very comfortable beds and great location ,1
 1 aggressive interrogation by staff on our return from the ballet on Friday night including an insistence of taking our key and checking it in their reader 2 a 15 min queue for breakfast clearly no thought given to guests and their needs Location,0
"Check in was a pain, copies made of my credit card and license and I think that's illegal, but I was able to get the copy. Rooms plain and the towels were old, thin and dirty. I've used better towels to dry my dog! The TV was fuzzy with bad reception it was noisy and no place to eat nearby, the gas station next door had bars on the windows and thick glass. The breakfast was a nasty little honey bun and stale cereal. And the clerk was a sleep behind the counter. I will not recommend or ever stay there again, NEVER! And internet was a pain to get on, with logging in, timers and passwords that would allow you to access much at all.",0
No Negative Friendly staff pleasantly surprised by facilities quiet comfortable air con in room enjoyed my stay good value for money would happily stay there again ,1
"We stayed here over the June -- weekend. Will definitely stay here agaon, the location is perfect....so close to Chinatown, wonderful soho shopping and Little Italy! You are perhaps a - min walk to the red -,-,- subway line and same to the Blue C,E line which makes it very convenient for travel to the times square area. Easy to walk as well to the Trade Center site. The staff was excellent, especially Jay at the front desk. He was very helpful and gave us perfect directions! 
Our room was spotless and had an extremely comfortable bed. Breakfast each morning was very good and we liked the atrium that the dining area was in. Well done Hampton Inn Soho!",1
No Negative Nice helpful staff Good breakfast Easy walking distance to public transport and main city sights Bigger than average room Quiet location ,1
 The reception on check out and check in was very busy Staff were swamped and did their best to see to everyone as quickly as possible  Room was nice and large comfy big bed and tea and coffee facilities The breakfast in the morning had an excellent selection Front desk staff were very helpful ,1
 This hotel is really far out and there is nothing around the hotel  The airport transfer,0
 Room was smaller than the pictures Getting in to the shower involved a tight squeeze between the toilet and having to step into the bath no walk in separate shower  Great location modern clean staff were helpful and well presented On checkout the staff were arguing between each other regarding going to work and making friendships whilst the other member said they don t come to work to make friends ,1
 HUGE EXTRA ROOM SERVICE DELIVERY CHARGE n I ordered 2 yogurts and 2 pineapple juices from room service They charged me 33 EUROS The hotel already charges a high price for the room They should NOT CHARGE A HUGE EXTRA CHARGE JUST TO DELIVER A MEAL They should only charge for the food ,0
 The hotel is trading off the Montcalm over the road but I have stayed at both and the Montcalm has full facilities This location has very limited facilities and appears to be a poorly serviced overspill location which simply negates the association with the Montcalm No Positive,0

 Smell in the roomNo Positive,0
 Rude Service with poor knowledge of their F B and a strong Hotel smell which reminds more of Arab style Hotels which incidently I do like but the hotel doesn t have the wha wha whum for it  Location was good positioned and made traveling by cab easy ,0
 The flooring was dated and needed some repair The room although adequate was on the small side  The location was perfect close to Marble Arch and everything that London has to offer Breakfast was included with our booking and was excellent ,1

 Room was very noisy Room 36 It was an adjoining room and could hear everything from other room mainly their TV No window so felt very stuffy actually overlooked swimming pool so would have to close curtains even in daytime to get privacy Ideal room if have kids in adjoining room but horrible for us as a young couple enjoying a night away without children  Nice clean hotel with close access to kilburn station Car park easy to use and good cost per day Shower was good Breakfast was nice ,1

 Dirty smelly room had no window bed at 30 cm from bathroom door so that one could only open half of it and had to squeeze through to go in Bathroom new and clean but that is about the only good thing that one can say about the hotel Definitely not worth the money  First room they gave me had no window Terrible ,0

No Negative Rita ,1
"After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical but took the chance anyway. We had a great experience! The front desk staff were helpful and friendly, the room, although a bit worn, was clean and comfortable. The hotel does allow pets and Denny Park is about a block away. There are also some handy spots right in front of the hotel. Just make sure you bring your own baggies to clean up after your pet. It's a mile or so walk to the Market, but the streets are pedestrian friendly. Breakfast was the usual- waffles, muffins, yogurt, cereal. Hotel is under renovation right now, but we were not inconvenienced by noise, workmen, etc. Free parking was a plus.",0
No Negative the location of the hotel In the heart of London,1
No Negative Fantastic location and lovely staff,1
 Nothing Really great staff so helpful I would definitely recommend We went here on our honey moon and slept under the stars,1
 There was nothing I did not like  I loved the warm personal feel of this hotel and it s furnishings The staff were very friendly and so helpful with information about sights transportation restaurants etc which really enhanced our experience Breakfast in the grotto was great also ,1
No Negative The hotel staff are excellent and location is quite and perfect close to most of important tourist sites,1
 The bed was hard and uncomfortable Very loud music was being played in the bar in the evening which made sitting in the lounge impossible Breakfast is served in Jamie s next door The queue for breakfast was slow moving and the service poor  Great location,0

 Hospitality we spent 1 hour to check in at 11pm with 2 small kids the elevetor didn t work during the whole stay we were at the 5th floor I skip the rest  Location,0
 We were surprised that the hotel did not provide food after hours perhaps consider a simple light bite in room menu but they recommended a takeaway shop and arranged delivery for us  Beautiful renovated building with trendy and quirky interior in a quiet location yet within easy access of main attractions The UK plug socket came in handy as I had forgotten my adapter The staff were friendly professional and very efficient Our suite was very quiet and the beds 2 singles pushed together very comfortable The hotel is next door to a fantastic food hall which serves almost every type of food you can imagine on the Thursday evening it was transformed into a large sophisticated drinking venue and had an amazing vibe ,1
 The original agreement with the reservation was broken at check In We had an awful experience not a family friendly place We are a family of six two of our kids had to sleep in room alone although the original agreement was different they are both minors and we had sleepless nights going to their room many times at night and them calling us every couple of hours Let go having to unexpectedly pay for a third room  Breakfast was good rooms ok,0
 Room was a lo Little tierd and expensive  Very helpful friendly staff Wonderful shower ,0
"I only stayed here because my work paid for it. If I had to use my own dime, I would not choose to stay here. The rooms with - Queen beds were almost claustrophic. There is no room to move. The bathrooms are tiny! Nice TV. Room barely got cold enough for us. Motel restaurant prices are exorbitant.
Great service but dark, small hallways. No free internet.
Greatest part of this motel is the rooftop pool. It rocks! 
Great location for touristing.
Beds absolutely sucked! They have old mattresses with another pad placed on top. Uneven sleeping...woke up with headache every morning.",0
 The rooms were a little cramped I accept in London you are limited by pace but at that price it was a little surprising to have such a small bathroom and bedroom  The staff were very welcoming The restaurant had a fresh and excellent selection of food Location of the venue and my event meant that I was always close to leisure and work simultaneously ,1
 I booked this hotel because of the Gym and Spa only to find on a Sunday it closes at 7pm Hotel looks tired can do with up dating Food and service was good,0
 Towels in bathroom were not clean as expected Even we saw red stein on the towel  Very friendly Staff ,0
This hotel needs some serious renovations. The walls in my room had peeling paint and scratches. The decor was horrid and so mismatched. Made no sense at all. You could hear everything going on in the hallway or room next door at any given time. The bathroom was small and the toilet and shower drain kept clogging up. We had to call the front desk twice on separate occasions to fix these. The only thing four star about this hotel is their lobby-restaurant area downstairs. Its in a prime location downtown which comes in useful since you dread going back to your room.,0
 Far from city shuttle to metro at evening costs 10 euro for person Wifi costs 10 euro per day There was humidity under shower No Positive,0
 It s not my favourite kind of hotel Not so warmNo Positive,1
 Unfortunately it was disapointment about serviss 1st girl at recepti on when we arrived 1 hour before cheking time seemed really exausted didn t look at clients didn t smile later after cheking in our time we called reception to ask to get soap as soap bottle in the toilet room was empty but we didn t get it when we checked out we had to wait a long time another girl from serviss helped to find reception girl who didn t even appologize and after cheking that our bill is paid ai everithing is fine with out saying goodbuy or smth like that A real disapointment for 4 star hotel  It s nice to have possibilitie to place car in garage for aditional cost the room was clean ,0
 Awfull internet poor view from the window a little bit far from city center very friendly and helpful staff especially reception ,0
 Although it does say in the hotel details there is no bar I did find this inconvenient had to take quite a walk to find somewhere open after the concert at the London Stadium No one loathes drunks more than me but a couple of drinks to finish off the evening would have made my stay more pleasant  Friendliness of the staff everywhere was very clean Complimentary newspapers were a nice touch Location for the London Stadium is excellent ,1
 The room The attitude of reception It was not Value for money The room was small we rejected the first double as it was a corner room and tiny they wanted us to pay more for a twin on 5th floor I refused to pay extra they said we were late arriving I had said it was a late arrival The twin room was small and poorly finished and so hot we could hardly breathe I have stayed before but won t stay again Not happy,0

"Worst experience ever! Roaches everywhere! One so big he could have helped me bring my suitcase upstairs, and the room and washroom were full of them as well! All around dirty!!!!! Never again! In order to use the washroom, you had to walk backwards to get in there! Worst Hotel EVER!!!",0

 Although extra pillows were provided they too were over plump and not necessarily a good alternative Was a bit disappointed with breakfast Great choice but served on the cold plates that were already on the table and no apparent alternatives No side plates or chance of one Very good choice of continually replenished breakfast items but coffee only warm and tea mediocre What is the problem with promoting what is good about Britain in a great quality product like Yorkshire Tea 20 is a lot of money for this breakfast which although plentiful is not a quality product  Very good location and impressive hotel Staff were always friendly and welcoming ,0

 The cleaning of the sink wasn t good I cleaned myself around the plug hole and taps and removed the dirt easily Walls could have been wiped down there had obviously been a spillage next to my bed of coffee tea but on the whole for the price it wasn t bad Bed was very soft but surprisingly didn t aggravate my back air con worked well and wasn t too noisy the young girl with dark hair on reception was lovely extremely helpful replaced our kettle and brought extra tea etc when housekeeping had failed to do so,1

"First day, sink did not work, a-c thermostat did not work, -- degrees all - days, drain pipe in ceiling over tub dripped water continously, these were never fixed despite reporting them. No coffee available except for small pot in room. This hotel is okay, has no amenities, is not worth the price.",0
 The hotel was in the middle of renovation works so we did not get the room we initially booked To avoid noise from the construction works we were placed into a standard room instead of a comfort room No reimbursment of costs were offered Our room smelled of mould or cigarettes or both There were some hair in the bathroom plus it smelled of pipes Everything was a bit dated and worn out so I m hoping that they are renovating not just the lobby  Beautiful old manor house with a nice park around You can see the whole Vienna from your window Quiet and tranquil location with good public transport connection to the city center ,0
 Our room had been given to someone else upon arrival There was much consternation but all was solved with rather abrupt apologies The same staff was very helpful on finding a list back left on a taxi however So a wash  Terrific location in Milan s retail fashion district There was much to see and do and the staff helpful The room was efficient and well laid out for comfort ,1

 Fire alarm fault went off at 4am Room dirty Bathroom filthy Decor tired and communal areas had a bad smell Location,0
 The area is dodgy The hotel does not fit in the neighborhood It s difficult to move around by car or bus because the roads around the hotel are jammed most of the time Best way to move around the hotel is by walking or the underground Which are not the types of transportation a guests of such hotel would prefer I presume  High attention to details I placed my book on the table Retuned to find a bookmark on it On my check out night I found a transparent plastic bag left for the liquids a traveler might take on a plane ,0
"Do not stay at this hotel unless they cut you a killer deal, and even then ask yourself how desperate you are!
Fundamentally there's nothing wrong with the building, but the management suck, there are not enough staff, they are badly trained, they don't act upon complaints and do not deserve your custom. 
I can't be bothered to write an article length piece describing what went wrong, suffice to say everything that could, did.
At your peril...",0

 Too far from tube station No resturants or coffee shops nearby Did not like the Mac computer as TV too small a screen A large screen TV would be more beneficially than an small MAC computer TV  Room very comfortable though slightly on the small side Gym good Staff very friendly Close to Thames river for walks ,1
 Our only negative comment is that on the first night the room was really warm The thermostat had been set to 25 degrees which was quite frustrating but after we fixed it the temperature was fine  The room we had was perfect and the location was great We really liked the serve yourself bar and felt it was a nice touch The hotel staff were really helpful in providing tips and recommendations in the area ,1

"We booked a stay here to tour the historic area of Philadelphia. The only good thing about the hotel is the location and the nice shuttle drivers. The hotel is poorly maintained. One elevator was broken both days, the wireless internet did not work, one bed in our room had a broken box springs, the window was so poorly installed that there was a huge gap to the outside. When we complained all the desk clerks said was no one else has complained or we will make a note of it....never any effort to check into the problems or see that they are fixed. We heard several people complaining about the same things during our stay. We checked out early and went elsewhere.",0

It doesn't have any bells or whistles but I was happy. There was no musty smell--everything was new. Subway right around the corner. Staff was friendly enough. 
Really--if you don't need a lot of fancy things and just need somewhere decent to stay, I highly recommend this place. Even if you are a first time traveler to NYC, stay here instead of Midtown. The subway is nearby and you can take the Express up to Midtown.",1

"We went to the Inner Harbor for a quick getaway, Just -- hours. Fortunately we picked the best weather day in March to go, and the best place to stay The service and conveinence were unmatched. From check-in to check-out everything went smoothly. A room with a view, comfortable bed, and an indoor swimming pool. Saturday morning we had the buffet breakfast and were so impressed with the food we had to speak to the head chef. There is even a raised walkway that conects the Sheraton to the Inner Harbor.",1

 Staff were too under pressure to be helpful Breakfast very poor staff were carrying food from hotel across the street Basement room no windows opened Hairdryer not in sight of a mirror aircon dripped down the wallpaper Nothing,0
 Some of the staff need training both in systems and in customer service The beds in some rooms are great and in other rooms not so great too hard Big hotel with lots of people in motion all the time  The bathrooms are really nice and newly renovated The breakfast is good The room was quite but the view was not nice some kind of minimal courtyard with a dead bird ,0
"I booked this hotel based on excellent reviews , but I was very disappointed, the room was very noisy , I called for room service for some sugar and after -- minutes I receive coffee mate instead , the concierge did not want to help the guests, not a good location",0
No Negative The staff were cooperative and friendly ,0
 From the lobby to the elevator is difficult to reach by people in a wheel chair I one day had to help a woman in a wheel chair to push and to reach the elevator The floor is not horizontal  The breakfast buffet was excellent Wide range of delicious choices Fruit juices delicious and the champagne was appreciated We liked the Klimt designs in the room and in the building very much ,1
 Nothing comes to mind Always like staying here I travel to London most weeks and like to get out of the real centre of town when staying over Westbridge has that bit of distance but it only takes 25 30 mins door to door from my office in Soho Staff are always great rooms are very comfortable gym does the job and room service is quick and tasty ,1
"One of our partners called the hotel and asked for a room with an Indiana CPA Society corporate rate. The young man immediately said those rooms are sold out. Suspicious, she called the national reservations number and got the corporate rate without issue.
I stayed there this week using the CPA Society corporate rate that I got from national reservations. I was given a room that smelled of smoke, was pretty outdated and the bedspread was dirty. 
I feel that I was singled out for my discounted rate and relegated to a not-so-nice room. 
Oh, and someone near our room apparently fell asleep with the television blaring. It lasted until - a.m. You would have thought that on a security walk-through, management would have gotten it quieted down. But, there were probably no security walk-throughts, either.
So, what the did hotel accomplish? I'll never stay there again.",0
 As residents of the hotel we were refused entry to the bar on the higher level due to it being full Really  Staff at reception were very helpful friendly and welcoming good breakfast selection though can be a bit of a scrum when the hotel is very busy ,1

 Bar area lacks soul  Decent hotel in reasonably central location ,0
 Long line at front desk most of time had to go up and down 2 to 4 times a day and wait at that line for the room key card access problem  The location near Oxford St and between Bond and Marble Arch underground around 15 20 min walking to Madam Tissue ,0
 Out of town 40 minutes on foot to the Olympic stadium Hotel rooms are pricy but reasonable by Amsterdam standards hotels in general are very expensive in this city However meal prices are exorbitant 25 euros for breakfast  Excellent 4 star hotel Excellent choice of hotel for the Amsterdam marathon half way between the airport and the marathon start finish point Olympic stadiup Easy and frequent bus connection to city centre 15 minute trip bus stop 300 yards away from hotel Same bus takes you to the Olympic stadium 5 minutes Well located for the airport with free and frequent shuttle service M S mini food market just next door so you don t have to pay the hotel s absurd prices for breakfast The rest of the day you can spend in town anyway thanks to the bus service,0

 A fridge in the room would have been nice Amazing location concierge went above and beyond,1
No Negative We arrived at 9am exhausted from an overnight transatlantic flight The man on reception arranged for us to check in early so that we could recover before meeting with family ,1
 The fire alarm went off with 3 sounds at 1 22am nothing was said about it They charge almost 5 per hr for WiFi we stayed at another holiday inn a few weeks previously Wi Fi was free  We had a smoking room which is unusual to get these days Room was clean comfy ,1
No Negative Staff was very friendly and helpful and beds were comfortable Handy shuttle service from hotel to airport ,1
 Air conditioning was not working for the whole of our stay during warm weather Staff were totally unconcerned and could only offer as a solution open your window could have worked that one out myself As a result room was very noisy with trams running pas the building and usual city noise Hotel management lacked any leadership to resolve the issue  Location Very close to metro line and easy walk to city centre ,0
 some confusion over the breakfast deal was resolved by a very helpful restaurant manager Good Location for attending event at Olympic Park Parking at a very reasonable rate rooms clean and fresh good bedding and towels staff were very friendly and helpful,1

"The location is convenient for walking,catching a cab or even taking the train and there are many restaurants in a wide range of price ranges, offerings. The room was nice but the turn down service was inconsistant...they knew that there were two people staying but they laid out the night amenities for only one. the continental breakfast in the restaurant is a bit spartan with good breads but bad coffee and slow service. finally there was a huge mix up with the bill that took - calls and multiple emails and - different people to remedy even though the bill was finalized, received, reviewed and confirmed prior to departure and in person additional room charges appeared even though the room was prepaid in advance so double the cost was charged.",0
 The room Everything is perfect exepct keys of the doors old and very big,1
 Nothing Very cool and close to everything very respectable reception I like the hotel I will come bac agen,1
 No parking at hotel street parking is sparse and you have to watch the signs if you leave your car on the road Otherwise options like the Marriott offer parking spaces single day at 35  This property is in a great location close to public transport lots of food options and if you bring a car into the city you will find parking nearby at the Ibis or Marriott it is not cheap Wife had the breakfast and thought it was good ,1

 This is not a hotel it s a takeaway with rooms above it The clientel were quite intimidating for a solo female returning late at night The stairs are so narrow that I would be concerned how to get out in case of fire The room was tiny and mostly taken up with a double bed the whole place has a slightly strange atmosphere No Positive,0
 ROOM IS VERY DARK AND NOT COMFORTABLE CLEAN,0
 The breakfast is expensive 15euro you have a lot of cold food and also coffee included but I think the wright price I think it is closed to 10euro The food on restaurant on ground floor is not the best The Rooms walls are a little bit thinner  The position is perfect if you stay more days and you re looking for a hotel to be closed to beach and also closed to center of town The area around is not the best but the neighborhood in general is ok The rooms are beautiful big clean and they have also comfortable beds ,1
 Cleaning of room tended to be late afternoon when we came back from a day out and wanted to chill in room although not a big issue and not all people probably had this issue as it was probably the time of day they serviced our floor Couldn t get internet working on tv as booklet was vague Only English news channels on tv would have been nice to have an English speaking light entertainment channel  Hotel was very central to the city in walking distance from most attractions and in a nice area Liked the blackout blinds air conditioning staff were very friendly and easy to understand enjoyed the roof top terrace bar Room was very comfortable with fridge bar and safe ,1
 I am in a wheelchair and the fire alarm went off at 11pm while I was staying on the 7th floor I was very disappointed no hotel staff came to see if I was ok and I had to make my own way down 7 flights of stairs  We got a very good price for a room While not in the city centre it is very handy to the Metro,1
 the room needs renovation Not the standard expected from Hilton and not like our previous stays We liked the service and the location,1
 The hotel didn t accommodate our early check in No Positive,0

 Breakfast could ve been better Clean and stylish hotel Great location Nice staff ,1
 Light concept in rooms could be better Kind staff interesting design,0
 I was searching for a socket for the hairdryer and found it difficult to dry my hair using the mirrors on the side of the tv I feel a mirror could be placed over the dressing table running the length under the tv for drying hair whilst sitting down  Staff were very helpful and friendly They surprised my husband with a bottle of prosecco for his 60th birthday in our room We also received an upgrade as we are members of loyalty scheme which was a lovely treat We were delighted with the huge bathroom ,1

"On arrival we were given the wrong room due to overbooking and had to spend the first night of our - night stay in a small room which was not suitable for our party. The next day, thanks to the manager, we were moved to a room which was better than the one we had actually booked and he did what he could to ensure we were happy. In the end a nice hotel, with nice staff and a lovely stay. Perfect location too. This review could have been so different though, had they not dealt with the problem so effectively.",1
 Tepid water and poor shower water pressure Only one pillow each and thin small towels no one serving on the bar tried to take our payment just the day before we arrived and then said the bank had decined our credit card our bank said there was no contact from them  We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the Gare de Lyon,0
 The people were ignorant the service was poor and the food was terrible and the hotel was old and dirty The location,0
 The mini bar just didn t work We were not given fresh towels at any point on our 3 night stay The local restaurants were extremely poor standard Mainly though loads of other guests were smoking cannabis right outside the main entrance to the hotel which meant the stench was lingering inside the hotel at reception etc Very nasty first impression I understand the coffee shops are a huge part of tourism in Amsterdam but as far as I m aware it isn t legal to smoke cannabis in public and I was especially astonished that none of the staff at the hotel seemed bothered by the fact they reception area stunk of it  The room was very stylish Location was handy for travel to and from the city center and also Schipol ,0
 Location was poor the hotel is looking very tiered the staff were far from helpful it was very noisy and cold I think the later is probably due to the single glazing  There was nothing I liked about this hotel ,0
 BREAKFAST NOT WORTH THE COST WOULD PREFER A SHOWER CUCBICLE RATHER THAN IN THE BATH ROOM COMFORTABLE,1
 The size of what is considered standard double bed is very small The breakfast was very good,0
 Nothing Everything,1
 The room could have been a bit bigger and the bathroom too we felt like we were falling over one another at times Explanation on how to use the information panel on the outside of the room to let staff know you didn t want to be disturbed bit awkward when we were getting ready to go out  Very comfortable bed and big too Good that you can actually open the window in the room too The shower was really nice and big just what you needed Good beverage prices especially for London ,1

 the water in the bathroom was dirtyNo Positive,0
 The pool was not usable on the day of our visit Additionally the photographs on the website are misleading One of the reasons we chose this hotel was due to a picture of a terrace bar seating area Unfortunately this is not for guests but only in the penthouse room Very disappointing stay with two of our reasons for booking not being available or as described No Positive,0
 Nothing really  For us since we wanted to go to the Ziggo Dome the location was perfect We took our bikes and it s less than a 10min bike ride to the Arena square I think they also offer a shuttle bus service Obviously the hotel tower looks attractive especially at night with the blue color The rooms are special with a circle shower in the middle of the room We got free welcome drinks which we enjoyed in the lounge bar on the 17th floor with a very nice view ,1
 Beds too soft Air conditioning noisy Asked on checking out if stay had been good and not interested in the above feedback Was no point asking me the question Majority of staff were nice Restaurant reasonably priced,0

 Room was very small No wardrobe to put clothes in No amenity kit No mini bar No slippers Rooms smell nasty No chair to change shoes you have to sit on the bed No bathtub only shower and odd enough they supplied a floating duck don t know what was its purpose Water wasn t flowing properly so the shower wasn t enjoyable  They provided a mobile phone that made my life easier with unlimited data and all for free The location is very good ,0
No Negative Daniel at reception was friendly and pleasant with the kids making them feel welcome ,1
 All the rest We were in the lower ground room LG5 which feels damp smells of tobacco and looks like a badly converted cellar The room and the whole experience was probably worth 40 less than the price we paid  Location is quite good,0
 The water in the pool is very cold  The location is great The rooftop pool is great with the bar and the lounge Breakfast is really good ,1
A great hotel with great service- worth all the money!,1

No Negative everything was excellent the hotel staff room breakfast thank you so much,1
 The staff took less than 20 minutes to make the bed clean the bathroom and clean the bedroom Impossible The bed had a mattress protector which did not fit correctly therefore it was crinkled underneath the bottom sheet and could not be straightened so uncomfortable all night The lighting was terrible you could not see either in the bedroom or the bathroom so no chance to apply make up correctly We always book with booking com both in England and Spain and this is the first time we have been very disappointed and felt we had to lodge our complaintNo Positive,0

 room is small same as many hotels in London  staff were welcoming and very nice the interior design is unique and got its charms ,1
 Staff quite cold hard to understand accent  Great room nicely thought out ,1
 The neighbourhood could be a bit dodgy after late past 11pm You are advised to take a cab back to the hotel if returning late  Comfortable good sized room with a generous bathroom Great location between two major metro lines walkable distance from major attractions such as Montmartre Moulin Rouge etc ,1
 Breackfasts were disastrous On Saturday morning we had to wait over 30 minutes to get to breakfast room and still we couldn t get one table for me and my daughters All the food that was meant to be warm was already cold and there was hardly anything left Getting coffee and tea took ages and whole hall was pretty messy And we weren t there even late about 9am next day we went earlier because of our flight but when we came back out there were a lot more people waiting to get in to breakfast The location of the hotel was perfect Just by the underground and some really good restaurants ,0
 The staff were awful I d never stay here again  Nothing ,0

 The fact that you have to pay for parking and the car park wasn t clean and we ll presented  The staff where frendly ,0
"The staff at this hotel goes above and beyond. Everyone was not only friendly but actually helpful. They even offered help before being asked. The breakfast staff was patient and understanding of the needs of our group of - children. When the airport shuttle did not show up as scheduled, the manager hopped in her personal vehicle and drove me to the airport. No shoulder shrugs and sorry I can't help you at this hotel. We had a two bedroom suite which was spacious and well equipped. I think the only negative was that the indoor pool at the Marriott Courtyard next door was freezing cold so the kids were a bit disappointed. But they had fun playing on the basketball court instead.",1
No Negative Reception lady was super helpful,1
 Nice property but extremely poor customer service that made me cut short of my stay they almost made me sleep out in the cold I was tempted to call police on them Horrible experience Sad No Positive,0
 The only one thing I did not enjoy was the sausages at breakfast  Everything was fantastic was my husbands birthday and hotel staff went to every effort to make it special for him ,1
 Rooms are very small Location is highly recommended,1
 This hotel seems to trade on a glorious past The room I was first allocated on 6th floor was like an attic room with NO view I was moved to larger 5th floor room but again NO view The decor of the rooms and corridors whilst clean were very very dated and well below the standard of a 4 hotel The American Bar was a HUGE disappointment Also do not expect a welcoming lobby with nice seating areas perhaps like the photographs of many years ago they like to show Breakfast was fairly good but there seemed to be very little system in place so you either waited ages for staff or 3 came in quick succession  Location front of house staff cleanlinless building from outside and cafe ,0

 Having my door knocked at 0800 which got me up by cleaning staff i told them we didnt check out for a few hours and they still came back half an hour later really annoying Apart from that all good Great venue pleasant helpful staff very clean comfy room nice tv and coffee tea making facilities nice bar really good stay would stay again ,1

 somehow anonymous Nice breakfast geographic location near the center and easy to reach by public transports ,1
 People in other rooms made lots of noise which was disappointing it was so easily heard not great sound proofing If you like boutique shops and restaurants great hotel location easy access to central London,1

"The room was clean but did have cosmetic issues; paint chipping, cracks in the ceiling, etc. The major issues I had with the hotel were the food stunk!!! Over priced and not even close to being worth the money. If you have time (which I didn’t ) venture out, there are great restaurants in the area. My only other complaint was, the last night of my stay the room became very hot so I tried to turn on the air. Even on cool and high, the vent blew out nothing but hot air. I was lucky the window opened a little.",0
 Drinks in the bar were pricy but that is London You sertainly thing twice about another round  frendly staff very helpful room was good size and clean hotel in good location to see sites,1
 The creaky bed Everything except the creaky bed ,1

 A few more English channels apart from the news because when we got home from walking around all day it would have been nice to watch a film in English Also it was my birthday a little bottle of wine would have been nice and a few more chocolate s  Lovely room really comfy bed Paula Andrea and the guy at reception were really helpful ,1

"Stay was okay at best. Rooms are super small and can get claustrophobic when trying to escape the rain. Wireless internet was terrible in the rooms, barely could stay connected. Room thermostat didn't work right, would either keep blowing hit air non-stop or would shut off completely so we would be either sweating or freezing. Probably will stay somewhere else next time we visit Seattle...in fact we are. Next time in February we will be at the Hyatt.

 The hotel is so bad the bath room water is not all the time there and it happain many time and they do care about that customer Just the location,0
 maybe if there was a bath in the bathroom almost everything was perfect,1
 We booked an executive club room and was given a standard they said nothing we could do as no other rooms available My sister went back up to her correct executive room and someone else had checked into it although she had already done so and her belongings were in the room The couple said they thought this was odd as a porter took the stuff to lost property The duty manager just said sorry but he couldn t do anything Cannot believe we paid executive prices when we stayed in a room so small you would struggle to get around with your belongings out  I loved the location of the property that was as far as it went for me ,0
 First of all we have a bad impression from check in reception girls not polite with informations about rooms and parking Second one is the room was dirty specially bath dusty and sandy For a 4 hotel we have one little shower gel for 2 persons the fridge was smelling bad  Only good experience we had in this hotel was breakfast and the good location near bars restaurants beach,0

 Delayed flight meant we were 4 hours late arriving 1 45 am Phoned ahead to let hotel know Despite this and with NOBODY else around check in took nearly half on hour for our two rooms Noise from Air conditioning kept two of us awake And it woke us after we fell asleep Contacted reception offered new room but as we had to be up at 7 to leave at 8pm it wasn t worth the hassle On checkout expected some gesture from the hotel but I was stone walled  Location,0
 Not exactly city centre but if you have time and energy it is a nice walk along the beach Good value for money We had great view from our room ,1
 my friend has claustrophobia which meant she would not use a lift this seemed to cause a problem as we had difficulty with staff trying to find suitable stair access and she had to use fire escape stairs each time location cleanliness facilities and very helpful manager with the problem my friend had,1
 Nothing Right at hop on hop off bus tour location and top of las Ramblas Great location Great staff Close to Port also ,1

 The hotel needs an upgrade as bathroom was very dated and not clean Beds are very uncomfortable and the sofa bed is just terrible All theee of us had backache after only one night sleep there 4star for this hotel is definitely overrating Definitely not worth the money paid  Staff were very pleasant to deal with ,0

 First day we were sat down down quickly and staff were helpful The second day they were rushed off their feet and we were left standing 10min to be sat at a table It wasnt until i got fed up with waiting and sat my family down myself did they come over to say the table id chosen wasnt suitable and moved us It was then that i noticed the breakfast menu which wasnt on the table on our first day so we werent aware that there was alternatives to the buffet I asked for 2 poached eggs and 15min later had to ask again by which time my family had finished As for the buffet it had been emptied and we had to wait for that to be replenished as well Not good No Positive,1

 Nothing Everything,1
 The problems were the hotel isn t kept very well the room and hallways had an unpleasent scent the bathroom really needs refurbishment bathtub fills with water and the electrical sockets for the TV were hanging off exposing wires Hardly ideal when you have a crawling baby I didn t think the breakfast lived up to expectation either given the prior reviews The two main lifts you cannot use if you have a buggy as they are too small So you have to use the lift for the garage and even that is incredibly tight for 2 adults and a baby  Good location good to have onsite parking and the staff were nice ,0
No Negative Internet location,1

 Breakfast was poor low fat yoghurts only pancakes ran out and chef cooking omelettes seemed to disappear Lack of coffee and struggled to get into table due to the amount of tables pushed into one corner Bathroom tired and small Beds too soft and rooms small for family of 4  Clean and right by tube station,0
 The beds were too short I am 1m84 and my husband 1m90 and both our feet were hanging out There were not enough plugs in the room so we had to take turns charging our phones and camera The hotel does not deserve 4 stars maybe 2 or 3 stars tops  It was quite unexpensive and the staff was friendly ,1
 no coffee machine in the room about 10 euros surcharge for a taxi perfect location in the heart of Brera fashion district beautiful standard room big bright with balcony huge bathroom Clarins products in the bathroom free wifi working perfectly free access to the beautiful spa where very good quality tea apples and dry fruits are complimentary lovely personnel always trying to help you really good bed and pillows,1

 The hotel was in the middle of a building site which we weren t notified about Work started each morning at 7 30am even though we were told it wouldn t start until 9am You will need to take transport as its further out than mentioned when walking especially with kids  The rooms were very well maintained and modern ,0
 Nothing  Everything ,1
 The Wi Fi connection could be poor at times  If you are looking for a quiet boutique hotel situated within a great location in London The Pelham Hotel is the right place The staff are friendly and so helpful everyone is willing to go an extra mile for their guests Everything was good I mean it was my third stay there and I have no regrets I will be back again ,1

No Negative Good value great location helpful staff ,1
 The room was ok but I wouldn t stay here again There was only about 1 foot of space at the foot of the bed to squeeze bent over by the wall mounted TV to get to the other side Washcloths were not available even on request because they are afraid one might clean the kitchenette with them and lastly the remote didn t work properly but when that was reported the TV no longer worked at all The room was quiet though Most of the staff were very helpful  The room was spacious with the exception noted below Staff was mostly helpful ,0

No Negative Hotel was fair and was located in a good area ,0
 Nothing we didn t like  Very helpful staff nice location and room was clean We were upgraded to a Club Room at no extra cost ,1
 no free breakfast checking in was a hassle We needed to wait more than 2 hours before our room was ready you continually have to sign in for wifi each time you come back to the hotel not far from the hotel is a neighbourhood which does not look safe quite far from the city centre but doable the atm is not near You have to walk approximately 10 minutes to find one The rooms are clean and totally doable across the street are a few restaurants and also a small supermarket close to the metrostation on the 4th floor there is a place where you can iron your clothes youself wifi is good,1
 nothing at all If you stay in London stay at Hotel 41 from the greeting of complimentary champagne to the honesty bar snack bar there is everything you could every want here The staff knew your name and engaged in all conversation at every opportunity We loved this hotel just wish it was a little cheaper and we could stay longer The bottles of water snacks and hot chocolate by the front door was a simple but excellent little touch ,1
 Hotel room was not clean Our shower backed up and we discovered it was due to clogged drain with hair balls slime and other unknown nasty stuff Also room was coldNo Positive,0
 Small rooms shower complicated in a grotty location Looked like a cheap refurbishment in common areas Irish Times only free newspaper Breakfast room bland Few external windows Window in shower room meant disturbing anyone sleeping if light put on  Comfy bed Discounted price Convenient for Euston area but in a grotty location Looked like a cheap refurbishment in common areas ,0

 Staff bar and restaurant service very slow Restaurant meal not tasteful very poor value for money This lets down an otherwise very nice hotel Very clean and excellent room Reception staff very good,1
 some staff a bit demure but hey that s hotels for you Just a great place to stay for London Nice hotel with access to our own mainline station to travel in and out of London and also access to the rest of London,1
 nothing Location staff cleanliness comfy,1
 Little dated and no proper bar or restaraunt so no communal area to meet people Great Location near many key places and next to Metro Plus room was nice and large 407 ,1
"I visited the hotel with a group of friends for a celebration weekend. Dean Fearing's restuarant was FABULOUS! The food and atmosphere could not have been better. The waitstaff in both the dining room and bar gave excellent service as well.
Wish our hotel experience could have been the same. We checked in to find the room a bit untidy. There was someone else's trash in the trashcans and visible dust on the furniture surfaces. 
I completely agree with previous review that the pool area is lacking big time. Unattractive and pool attendant not helpful. We asked if an umbrella could be moved to give us partial shade and were told no. We did it ourselves. Drink service beyond slow.
Each time room service was ordered, it arrived either incorrect or missing condiments, etc. 
I would consider one of the other luxury hotels in the area on a future visit.....",0

 Walk across Rd to breakfast was inconvenient luckily the weather was kind othe wise would have been a problem Also breakfast wasn t great disappointed and Low level room very dark No way a 4 star  Comfortable bed,0

No Negative The Continental breakfast was great value and a good variety to choose from,1
 1 Hotel is nice but a bit too high tech to feel cozy 2 Bath and not just a douche even a good one would be a preference 3 Windows of my room were looking right at the window it the building accross the street felt a bit like in a shop window  1 Great location near Passeig de Gracia and Gaudi houses 2 Great personnel 3 Fresh apples on the lobby,1
 We stayed in a wing in a dire need of renovation The carpets were old and there was an unpleasant smell in the corridors Noisy elevators The room looked as it has not been redecorated for 30 years old refrigerator with some old flaking labels nothing inside apart from a box of juice left probably by previous occupants Wooden tub casing coming off and cheap Wifi coverage was ok but VPN connection was blocked so good for watching YouTube but no use for remote work and serious business I can understand there may be rooms of different standard in a hotel but then the charges should also be adequately discounted I am especially disappointed as I am a member of Hilton Honours programme  Good location tube pub stores within walking distance ,0
 Room 46 really too small It is on the station so if you don t have a deep sleep you might find it noising Rooms on the quiet street should be much better  Location is just 100 mt from Earl s Court station Kind staff Clean for London ,1
 Rooms very cold air con had to be left on to warm room which made an awful droning noiseNo Positive,0

 Time it took for room service Cleanliness,1
 Front desk staff can work on their friendliness skills  I usually stay at Starhotels Rosa Grand which is more pricey but lovely but had family staying nearby Starhotels Ritz so decided to try this property They also have a garage attached to the property and even though it was a hefty EU27 a night it was worth the convenience As with the Rosa Grand the breakfast is very good The location of this hotel is also better right off Corso Buenos Aires The room was extremely clean and had everything you need It s not as luxurious as the Rosa Grand but is certainly a very nice property for the price I d recommend it to friends ,1
 Staff are not well trained at least to realise that is their hote is 4 They have put me in a room and next day at 7 morning there was a work and noise of drilling next to my room I could not sleep went to the receptionist and told them they did not even say sorry and told me we will change you to different room them they change me to another room which was so small compared to what I pay for superior room I got upset and went to the receptionist again and told them and again no any sorry just simply told me we will change you room I spent the whole day from room to room very bad I like the hotel facilities,0
 the food is not good free breakfast free dinner and prefect location nice staff,1
 They served me stale and very foul smelling pepper i even have a video evidence for the same they even charged me for smoking which i really didnt in the room 150 euros Bad experience dont go to this hotel pleaseNo Positive,0
"I am a business traveler and have a client who uses this hotel. for meetings The staff are very friendly and helpful, there is access to the Skyway and the hotel is clean and has good amenities. The only negative is that there is no local transportation provided by the hotel. It's not easy to walk around the area, and though is is near the San Marco arts area, I wouldn't walk there alone at night from the hotel. So, if you can't get somewhere on the Skyway, there's no easy way to get around without a car, and the Skyway closes at -:--. Guests without cars would benefit from an area shuttle provided by the hotel, at least in the evenings if not all day.",1
 The walls were thin We could hear people outside very clearly The internet connection wasn t always consistent  Helpful staff Lively location and very close to the Magic Fountain show ,1
 My husband was on crutches when we arrived yet the room we were checked into initially was probably the furthest away from the lift Room and furnishings was very tired We had to ring to change which was dealt with There was a terrible smell in the corridor by the lift sewarage like smell for our entire stay Wifi was a bit hit and miss I would rate the rooms as a 3 standard which is disappointing considering the price and how impressive the lobby is  The lobby is really lovely and location is fantastic,0
 Air conditioning awful very hard to sleep when it it is over 80 degrees in your room every night Staff were very helpful,0
 The marsh mallow bed the loud party that seemed to go on till midnight and the twenty minute walk from the tube station to the hotel through rough residential area The double shower and expensive cocktails,0
 They need to explain a little more about parking and the price for breakfast  We only stayed for 1 night since We spent more time in Valencia Place is almos 5 blocks from Paseo la Gracia so is very close It was a nice Sandwish store right next which it was perfect because their breakfast is 15 per person per day plus is You planning to park in their garage is almost 25 per night Bed were very comfy ,1
 Breakfast was slow Expensive 250 for one night Traffic noisy at night windows were poorNo Positive,0
No Negative very helpful staff spacious and modern room great block out curtains lovely dining room convenient location for the start of my river cruise comfortable bed,1

 One receptionist very unprofessional and not a bit helpful Ruined a surprise birthday for my wife with lack of tact Asked for a fridge to be moved from middle of room floor and still there when checked out along with a perfect working one in its rightful place Working in tourism in through Ireland very disappointed with hotel  Location and room cleanliness and concierge staff friendly and helpful ,0
 Small room and not worth the moneyNo Positive,0
"That is the secont time I had been on a Omni. First time was in Orlando. Then in L.A.
All was just perfect, the Bed is great, the room. the location is also good.
The only small glitch is the shower can have a little more pressure, may be was at my room only, not bad, but can be better.
We had the FASTEST check in I ever had.
Just perfect.",1
No Negative Staff were very welcoming Clean room and very spacious Location was excellent Would definitely recommend ,1
 Services are far behind Not really a 5 star hotel The room is really tiny The design of the bathroom is not reasonable I got hurt every single time I got into the bath There was a night I just back to hotel Then I found out the mirror in the bathroom fall down And they just left it like that All my stuffs were messed up Ridiculous situation I ever met  Nice location ,0

"This hotel was ok for our needs. I was a little dissapointed as it had looked better on the website. The room smelled musty and damp. Apart from that, we had a good stay. We enjoyed the pool, the friendly staff and the delicious breakfast at the waffle spot.",0
 Our stay was Thursday 15th December There was a private Christmas party in a room downstairs When this finished the manager closed the residents bar as they wanted the revellers to disperse Although I understand the logic behind this it cut short our evening not at the private party just staying over The closure was made worse as once the revellers had dispersed the exceptionally unpolite bar man who said he was a concierge so it wasn t his job to serve drinks said each person that had waited patiently for an hour for the drunken crowd to leave could only have 1 drink each as it wasn t his job to serve This was at midnight which is not late I have never stayed in any other hotel in London that has closed its bar to residents Will not be staying again No Positive,0
 But over rated on trip advisor A bit far from center It s a nice clean boutique hotel There is walking by breakfast place with organic food Quiet area ,0
 There were many visible damages to the room on arrival which shows lack of care consideration Also 3 50 for one bottle of water is pretty ridiculous considering the price of the room The fact that the room was poorly cared for ripped up carpet burns to carpet damage to closet door  Location heating,0

 The lady is the spa was really rude to us grabbed me by the arm and tried to tell me off for not listening to her when all I was doing was looking in the direction she said the changing rooms were in Felt really disrespected and I didn t even want to stay in the spa due to how uncomfortable she made me feel  Hotel is well designed nice and clean Really welcoming country dutch locals are lovely and really helpful,0
 I booked a double room with 2 beds for me and my 16 yr old son Yet when we arrived they had reserved 1 double bed room They blamed booking Com for the mistake and gave us room with 2 beds which was smaller than room I paid for kettle never worked and took several calls and hours to replace it the tv blacked out after 5 minutes of watching  View from the roof terrace was amazing ,0
 The room I stayed was good size however I don t know how small it might have been if I didn t get an upgrade I booked for standard doubles To be fair this was my first time in UK and I didn t have a frame of reference to the size of the room I mostly travelled in Asia and I understand rooms in UK and Europe are quite small comparatively Great location and staff is friendly and helpful As I stayed for 7 days the hotel offered me a free upgrade which I really appreciated,1

 No window in the room that was ridiculous No Positive,0
 Lifts were a bit slow coming need more for the size of the hotel which was very busy  Clean modern comfortable hotel with everything you d expect for the price Professional helpful friendly staff even though they were very busy Great to have the option of car parking in a central Milan hotel Great location in lively area not bang in the centre but within walking distance and great public transport links ,1
 Swimming pool was a disappointment Not very large and also dirty Unfriendly cleaning staff did not respect Do Not Disturb sign Location not ideal if you want to visit center Barcelona Too far off  Front desk staff was very helpful ,0

 The price The location to theatres,1
 The bed was not comfortable There were no good facilities for people with babies we didn t like the breakfast Overpriced for what you get 4 hotel that only serves breakfast no lunch no dinner no sport facilities parking for your car which you have to pay for no extras in the room like iron water boiler coffee tea  Staff was friendly and the room was clean Nothing more positive I can say ,0

 I can t fault anything except the not so comfy bed slightly on the hard side  The staff were so friendly and very helpful as I had booked a different day by accident They managed to accommodate us and showed us to our room with an amazing view I would recommend staying here as it s also so close to some main sight seeing areas ,1
 Check in was slow with some panic by the front desk Room 327 an insult to be in this room NEVER put me in that room again Let s have some better directions to the rooms Location always works for me ,0

 It took me more than an hour to check in just because of my name was mistakenly recorded and the receptionist female blacks hair tie high kept that from me all the time without any apologies You know that after a long flight my almost 3 year old son was very exhausted and sleepy The attitude of the black receptionist was so bad that I doubted whether this was a five star hotel and I swore that I would never book this hotel and told all my friends  The view looking from the window is great ,0

No Negative Hotel was right opposite station,1
 The poor lighting in the bath  Pleasant staff comfortable and relaxing lounges quite rooms ,1
 the bed was a bit uncomfortable for me but that s because i have some back problems so maybe it might just be me  Location is perfect if you want to stay in the centre but away from all the tourist packed area the room i had was always well cleaned and spatious Excellent value for money and i would definitely come back in the future ,1
 Twin beds rather than double Shower not very powerful and too low for anyone over 6ft  The booking com transaction had apparently not been pushed through meaning we had to wait while the friendly receptionist sorted it out He kindly upgraded our room to Superior but I m not quite sure what the difference was as it wasn t very apparent ,0
 First room located so tiny Moved rooms after complaining second room had interconnecting door and we had really noisy neighbours Position,0
 Poor lighting in bedrooms impossible to read maps tube maps and guides to plan for next day  Wonderful choice of fresh fruits and breads for breakfast and hot buffet if wanted ,1
 The hotel is old and gorgeous only small negative is the rooms are quite hot especially in Summer windows were opened but not much breeze comes in if you are facing into the courtyard Location of Hotel fantastic you can walk everywhere or jump on the tube Rooms clean and beds really comfy Plenty of choices of restaurants around to eat Would definitely stay again for the location and its away from the hustle and bustle Quiet street ,1

 Service charge for breakfast when is this going to stop Breakfast good plenty of choice fresh juice was top draw,1
"Like others, if you don't want to sleep in an oven, stay elsewhere. You can open the window, but as soon as you close it, even if the heat is off, your room will start to get hot. NOT comfortable for sleeping under huge comforter. Bathroom is tiny and poorly designed - love having to close the door to take a shower. Staff friendly, parking easy, location convenient, but overall kind of a dump, and perhaps the most unpleasant ES I've ever stayed in.",0
No Negative The rooms were spotless and the staff are lovely Lisa and Kevin were fantastic with my little boy when he hurt his foot ,1
 Hotel is woefully understaffed a long wait for reception marina bar etc we twice walked out due to no one taking our order Caesar salad missing 2 of its 5 listed ingredients No Positive,0
 The room tables had not been dusted nor were they during our stay The room refreshments facilities were good excellent coffee maker plus they had a kettle but no tea bags so not sure what the kettle was for Everything was excellent we did not use the restaurants so cant comment any further,1
 Bathroom sink thingy which was before the drain was not working properly water drained very slowly Bathroom door was from glass and in the night using the toilet lit the whole room just a bit inconvenient Airconditioning turned out to be just with fan function  Perfect location in terms of public transportation one undergorund stop was literally before the hotel door For people who like walking the Rathaus was approximatly 25 minutes of walking to the hotel Nachtmarket was 7 minutes walking distance Rooms to the courtyard were really silent wifi was working the entire stay week room cleand every day Small groceries store was on the next street bakeries nearby In our room there was a bath which we also found very nice ,1
 Breakfast was not included in the price  Location of the hotel to key London sites ,0
 Got back to the room at 4 15 pm The room hadn t been made up Asked for the room to be made up then went to the bar we were ignored eventually served bought 4 glasses of champagne were not even offered any nuts Bad lighting in the bed room In fact bad lighting everywhere gave the hotel a depressing atmosphere Curtain broken so couldn t pull it properly No lift from car park to room so we struggled with our luggage No Positive,0
 Didn t like the controls for the room Taking automation to a level where is becomes complicated and long winded to turn lights on or off Maybe that s just me Hotel is let down by the spa I have addressed this with the hotel Hotel was fab ,1
 My room was slightly noisy because of lift going up and down nearby The bar prices maybe just a little high and eating breakfast in the bar area was strange The range of the buffet breakfast could have been better  Location Location Location The Hotel was good Easy to find and the rooms were good Plenty of staff to help ,1
 It is totally a big disappointment Pictures in booking com don t reflect the actual condition of the Hotel It was the dirtiest hotel we stayed  Only the location ,0
 A little bit far away from metro station but acceptable I personally don t like two single beds put together as a King bed The price is much expensive  Hotel color was nice warm ,1
 Wifi only free for limited time Wifi shoud be free to paying guests for the duration of their stay imho  Excellent staff at check in and breakfast area breakfast itself was excellent with a lot of choice bed was comfortable and room was clean and modern ,1
 Everything Overpriced overhyped self important all round it was crap and we will not return ,0
"I have to say I don't understand the odd poor review this place gets. The rooms were good, the pool is great, and the pool bar was always open at the stated times. We had two rooms by the pool, and they were clean and modern. I didn't hear anyone complaining. The concert venue is close by, but always ends by -- pm. We even got to listen to Earth Wind and Fire for free! Shop around for a good rate and it is well worth it.
The area is good, the Island is relaxing, the views are fantastic, and the Bali Hai restaurant is worth a visit...",1
"The worst - hotel nights in my life...Crowne Plaza in Memphis is very, very, very, very noisy. Room was at second floor, jus in front of a very noisy highway, just over parking and just over a very noisy wind tunnel. Impossible to sleep ! Second night, at ---- AM, a truck emptying was working with more noise, under just under room windows ! If you want to sleep, you must go in other place.",0
 The room was very very basic the bed was big but very hard there was no bath having paid so much for a few nights room was very cramped staff were not that helpful in telling me about transport etc they just expected us to just get taxis  It was ok just very expensive for quite a basic room which was meant to be a superior room location wasn t ideal but public transport was close and handy to use the room was clean and nice and fresh ,0
 Room was not spacious very difficult to manage with two kids Staff are very helpful good location,0
 Hotel rooms were gained by outside access unable to double lock door from inside so felt unsafe Door handle also loose and shower base filled with water 2 Members of breakfast staff weren t very friendly  Close to Metro station on main line into city centre easy to find Hotel room large clean and comfortable Good choice at buffet breakfast Good hotel if you plan to be out and about sightseeing wouldn t recommend if you re looking for a hotel to relax in as there isn t really a bar area ,1
 The fact we were across the road down underground They were doing renovations and on the steep staircase they had plastic over the carpet One of our single mattresses you could feel the springs the small fridge didn t work the small container of milk we bought went off The wi dos overlooked the area where the staff had the linen Also late evening around 12midnight and later when we were trying to sleep we had staff bashing things around and talking right outside our opened window that we open to get fresh air not aircon  The only thing good was it was within walking distance to Sherlock Holmes museum and Beatles museum Also close to busses and trains Also it had a microwave so we could hear up dinner we had purchased ,0
 wifi not being free was a surprise compared to my previous trips when it was free 20 min first time is hardly good and surely not the right message for a business traveller proximity to business district of Canary Wharf,0
 Paid wifi in rooms a big minus for which I would think twice before booking again  The staff is very friendly and helpful ,1
 Thought the hotel food more expensive than expected The cost of the hotel was more than the value I have stayed here before  Front desk staff was wonderful ,0
No Negative The staff simply could not do enough the ultimate boutique experience we will return ,1

 As with many big cities rooms and bathrooms are quite small even in the Club rooms  Great location with easy access to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations and about 15 minutes walk from Paddington Station Airport Express Good eateries in Westbourne Grove and good Chinese eateries in Queensway Edwardian dark oak panelling through public rooms is impressive ,1
 Smallest double room I have ever been in Only way to get in bed was to shuffle sideways along the wall Totally unacceptable room for two people especially paying 614 for 3 nights in a so called club room The only way to close the bathroom door from inside was to squeeze between the toilet and bath Impossible for two people to move around at the same time The room photo shown on my confirmation mail did not resemble the actual room and was totally misleading  close to bus route clean modern room reasonable prices in restaurant,0
"Lovely, modern hotel in a great location of NYC. Very intriguing lobby and bars. BUT, when you get to the room it all goes down hill. Rooms are so small (mine was --- sq ft). My laptop didn't fit on the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""desk"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and there were not enough outlets to power my laptop w-o unplugging other things. I can't imagine how or where one would eat room service. Noise was also a problem. I had to check to make certain my window wasn't open because the street noise was incredible. You also hear everything in the halls. 
Bottomline, this place is not for a business traveler. And unless you plan to spend --% of time outside of the room on a pleasure trip, then Hudson Hotel may not be for you either. I'll not stay there again.",0
 Would have been nice to have Tea coffee making facilities in room  Boutique hotel in a great location just 2 minutes walk from Hyde park Marble Arch and the underground 10 minute walk from Oxford Street and easy access to anywhere in London Room was small but comfortable Mini bar and TV neither of which we used Lovely shower in bathroom Breakfast was nice in the basement dining area The lady serving was fabulous going the extra mile to provide my Mum with Gluten free bread on the 2nd morning after only having crackers on the first morning Such a lovely touch ,1

 Swimming pool area and changing rooms filthy appalling service in restaurant mediocre food and beds like trampolines to sleep on Certainly not a 4 star hotel and Holiday Inn Expresses are better and much cheaper  Not much ,0
 location very strange part of town Surrounded by two large abandoned buildings on either side of hotel When I say abandoned it looked like squatters would live there Quite scary looking on first impression in the evening bed pillows bed was extremely hard And pillows were worse Had a hard time sleeping bathroom For hand towels it was paper made to look like cloth breakfast was a churn burn school cafeteria style it was a large hotel and eating off site was not an option unless you took a rather long walk off campus would not return to this location It had great parking and the rooms were clean And we found a great bistro nearby called Piscinin Risto Pub ,0
 No matter Everything it is small ,0
 The room was absolutely tiny Never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 Euro is awful First night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small Couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed Awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger Location only,0

"I stayed at Comfort Inn by the Bay for four nights in early November ----. For downtown San Francisco, the room price is very affordable, especially with my AARP discount. The rooms are clean and adequate, the free continental breakfast is filling, and the desk clerks, especially Sarah on the afternoon shift, are helpful in explaining how to get public transportation, etc. Though this is a budget hotel, the airport shuttles and tour shuttles serve it along with all the major hotels. Buses come within a block of the hotel, and the famous trolley line is a short bus ride away. The only downside for me was the lack of a public computer for use. I had to go to a nearby internet cafe lacking a printer.",1

 They could have supplied sheets and blankets as required They could have explained how I could sleep with the bathroom light on all night or told me how to turn it off The hotel could not be in the middle of a very busy traffic round about with headlights shinning in the window all night and for 200 quid the staff could have been pleasantNo Positive,0

"We got this room on a budget. So our expectations weren't high. We knew that it wasn't going to be lavish and all. So when we get to the location all we could do was laugh . All of the surrounding buildings were abandoned. The windows busted out and weeds growing over them. So after everything was done we couldn't get another hotel. As we walked to the room there was a room with an open door which remained open the entire stay. When got to the room our pillows were yellow. Just all round ridiculous. The next morning we got up and I made the comment """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""surprised our windows weren't busted out"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" only to find the car parked across from ours the window was busted out.

 What I did NOT like was the following Bacon not cooked folded from the freezer and cooked in the oven so the bacon is not cooked in the middle The toaster not quick enough people queuing for toast Ate in the restaurant on four occasions the service from the kitchen was terrible Over ten minutes for bread and butter and 30 minutes for a main course This is a new hotel but the kitchen staff need to turn the food around in a quicker period of time The price of wine and brandy is extortionate no house wine of a reasonable price Bar seating is badly designed and failing Bedroom and Bathroom well appointed Iron and small ironing board in the room saves the hassle of asking reception for one Lighting controls are convenient on the small screen by the bed and at the entrance,0
"This was the first time I chose to stay in a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""boutique"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hotel in Boston. We got what was supposed to be a great rate ($---) plus taxes and parking and ended up paying at over $---. The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in, and I have been traveling for -- years. If you have read any other reviews on this site you will find reference to the maddening humming noise that actually made our room vibrate. The staff was over-friendly and the one hotel bar was closed for a private function. Complaints at checkout about the room size and noise were just ignored. Unless you are in town for a sporting event at the Fleet center you can do far better at hotels closer to Faniuel Hall.",0
 Breakfast not included Ridiculous bar prices Our room was very nice,0
 Room s somewhat outdated and small  Central in London breafast excellent ,0
"The hotel staff is very friendly, tehy are attentive to your needs and quick to assist. Housekeeping does a wonderful job without being to overbearing about your items being left out. There were a couple of things about this property I didn't like. -st. It's old, and I do mean old you can see the dingy carpets and the old fixtures and stucco style painting and trim. The conference rooms have very old and stained carpet and I wouldn't want to hold a wedding reception here. It is conveniet to the river and downtown Jacksonville. All in all I probably wouldn't stay here again, but for the price I don't think you will find anything better in Jacksonville.",0

There were picks used for fruit in drinks lying around from the night before and spilled drinks. Very gross. I did not want to be barefoot. Dangerous. I of course picked the trash up. Also, the pool could not even hold a fourth of the hotel occupancy. Very shaded. We were going to get away and relax at the pool. That did not happen.",0

Looks like the place has been remodeled, and I wouldn't like to have seen it before. The beds are sleep number beds, which I think is overrated. The workout room was nice and cool, but the equipment is horrible. The pool is tiny as well. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this place, nor will I be back.",0

We stayed five days, and the staff was basically no help with the room problems for the first three days untill I insisted they do something to make us more comfortable. Then they upgraded us to a king size bed in a room with no closet, and amenities (refrigerator, safe, desk, piled on each other. I was reminded of the look in a hotel where they forgot to plan for these amenities. NEVER AGAIN. They staff was indifferent.",0
 Stayed in a family room and shower was leaking I slipped whilst pregnant and hit my head on the stone flooring When I highlighted the leaking shower to a staff member they were fully aware of the leak and said that this was the best room in the hotel to which I responded I d rather have the worst room as long as it s safe This room should not have been booked out especially knowing that children would be walking in and out of the bathroom Staff were not friendly at all No Positive,0

 Unprofessional staff at breakfast Put us on the spot and kept hammering on about whether we allready paid for breakfast or not We didn t due to a misunderstanding when booking So they kept on hammering the issue until I settled it with reception We appreciate a tranquile atmosphere when just out of bed Not the kind of borderline harassement we experienced here The breakfast wasn t even worth it  Nice and quiet room Kettle and coffee machine in the room ,0

 Stayed in room 201 and the bed was a pull out bed which I find appalling as I paid for an executive room It was not comfortable and had a thin mattress The carpet was coming up at the join in the middle of the room and the hairdryer connection at the back of the draw when I pulled the draw out to get the hairdryer to work was aweful The cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better too as there was dirt in some places  Booked an executive suite and the room Was massive Really happy with the size and the staff were brilliant The spa was also amazing and loved the time we spent there ,0

"I generally really like Kimpton properties. Nice bedding - good amenities - a little funky - friendly customer service. 
This property has all of those things......it's just not my taste. My room has industrial grade gray carpeting, a futon for seating with a little mushroom shaped footrest. The TV and electronics are piled up in what looks like a dorm room contraption. Ken and Barbie photos on the wall. The bathroom is tiny.

 checking in given different room room not cleaned well I could not say that I like any except the helpful of one man at the front desk,0
 There s a lack of lighting in the room only has 2 lamps over the beds it s missing a central light On Saturday I wanted to sleep in and the cleaning staff knocked at the door every 30 mins now I know I did not leave the do not disturb sign on the door but if I dont answer the door I think it should be obvious  Close to the Danube very clean I stayed during the winter and it has good heating ,1
 The bar staff should pay a lot more attention to guests around the bar They seemed quite involved with each other while letting guests wait for their drinks  The room was absolutely awesome It is decorated from a music artistic perspective With cool art and objects in the room There even is an entire selection of vinyl from which you can pick your favourites to play in your room The room itself had a great view over the Amsterdam IJ river Just the view alone is worth it Furthermore it is also worthy to note that this hotel is situated just across the river from Central Station You can take the 24 7 365 days a year free ferry which only takes 2 minutes into the center of Amsterdam ,1
No Negative The whole experience at the hotel was amazing ,1
 I well only suggest a fluffy pillow every thing about this hotel was great the staff the location and the comfy rooms it s a 4 star hotel but really it worth every piney the staff are the greatest Viola loredana Michele Alberto pietro Federica the most welcoming ppl on planet earth I stayed in Milano for 3 days in this hotel and I came back after 2 weeks to stay for an other 6 days in the same hotel knowing that I well be among a family that greats me and they made my stay amazing they helped me with every question I had they told me about all what I need for a good shopping in Milano I well never consider an other hotel in Milano for my up coming Visets ,1

"Don't stay here if you want to get into a room at check-in time, because they're not available and the front desk people won't solve your problem. Their keys are also very temperamental; you'll find yourself returning to the front desk to get a new one.",0
 Very small room our friends paid the Same rate and had a bigger room  Location,0
No Negative Our second time here we love the Jaz hotel perfect for a luxurious trip to the Ziggodome only 20 mins from Amsterdam on the Metro,1
"Web site noted room service. None at all.
Upon arrival, advised check in within --- hour, due to cleaning.
- hours later (luggage could not be checked in-so we had to remain in lobby and and hold) advised room finally cleaned and ready. We noted many later arrivals who were checked in.
For a - hour cleaning this room, it had a dirty tub (looked like animal hairs) dirty sink and the smell in main room was undescribable.
Air conditioning did not work. Account Access was not available (site kept showing available later).
Extremely disappointed-put a damper on whole trip.",0
 I came out with a bad red rash all over my body due to the shower gel provided in the bathroom Very inconvenient while travelling Also room was TINY I was travelling alone so more than one person wouldnt not fit in the double room  Friendly staff and clean ,0
"Stayed here for a conference, had a two queen suite. Suite does come with refridgerator and microwave. There were only two washclothes and - shampoo provided daily. No conditioner, so bring your own. We had a riverwalk suite on the -th floor but the street noise was terrible. There was constant honking and city buses passing by, and even with the room fan at full blast, I found it difficult to sleep. The rooms are clean but reminded me of a motel not a hotel, so If you are looking for that boutique experience....look elsewhere. There is a decent full breakfast included and a nightly happy hour, The pool is postage stamp size. The front desk staff were, however, very accomodating and friendly. We travel a lot, so I have a pretty good basis with which to compare. Will probably go else where in future.",0
 walk into reception stank of jeyes fluid and reception itself absolutely reeked of an air freshener that smelt like cheap aftershave massively overpowering parking was ridiculously expensive compared to other london hotels I will not stay here againNo Positive,0
 We weren t aware that the penalty would be applied for smoking in the room they should tell the guest about the policy when they check in 200 euro has been added to my bill without a warning given or something to inform us of this  Everything was okay though the room is extremely small ,0
 elevator motor very audible 24 7No Positive,0
 We were in a basement room next to the kitchen and breakfast room which meant we were woken at 6 50 each morning by noisy staff preparing breakfasts The room was small the tv didn t work properly the fridge hadn t been cleaned out and there was musty smell 3 beds were squeezed into a very small room which was billed as a triple room  Good location,0
 Breakfast was poor some eggs and desert which was very low quality It will be better for hotel not to serve breakfast at all or to serve the proper breakfast as it might be  I was on vacation with my girlfriend and stayed there for 2 nights Excellent staff they were very proffesional and helpful The room was quiet big and clean with the nice balcony ,1
Great location just west of Key Arena. Easy access to downtown via the monorail. Clean and new. Secure parking under the hotel for $-- per night. Friendly and helpful staff. Free internet access. Charged -- cents for ice. Microwave in room. Nice shower and tub in room. Small room. Bed not firm enough. Cable tv. Check out at noon. Free coffee and cokes (-) in room. Large Starbucks in building. Very reasonable price. Good value for price. Would stay again. We are locals who stayed here to have fun in downtown Seattle.,0

 The hotel staff does not have information of the city they do not know the area Very junior staff with no experience in dealing with clients They asked for a 100 deposit and gave us a handwritten receipt on a sheet of paper and told us that if we lost the receipt they could not return the deposit it s a shame that they do not invest in more prepared staff  The hotel is in a good situation close to the parks and tourist attractions next to the public transport and easy acces to any point of the city ,0
 Rooms are too small A C didn t work good Walking distance to many attractions,0
 location to London tube and bus is not so convenient It is also not convenient for calling Uber cars  the bed is comfortable and staff friendly,0
 The room was tiny you had to close the door in the bathroom to be able to move around and I could touch both sides of the room whilst stood in front of the window where the tv had been positioned due to the lack of wall space the dirty carpet with two large holes where furniture had warn through to the floor boards topped it off  It s proximity to the Grosvenor House Hotel where I was attending a function,0

 This property does not reflect Hilton image at all I stayed in 611 and found the room to be pretty stange interms of convenience access and in general Service was bad and the whole experience wasn t pleasant My colleague who stayed in 303 was earlier directed to a room where there was someone already staying and that too in the middle of the night A serious lapse on part of the hotel reservation team I would say there is a lot to improve upon  Nothing in particular but maybe cleanliness,0
 a waiter call me a PARROT and i think that was rude the bed was nice,0
 Extremely small room More like a closet than a room though bed was comfortable bath was well appointed  Clean modern good location,1
 room should have been more clean the furniture had spots and dirt on it Nothing that daily cleanup which was good could have cleaned Needs through cleaning breakfast was mostly oriented around glycose lactose and bread  excellent location Staff and service ,0
 Overrated and overpriced This should be in the category budget hotel I was told that my room was upgraded but I was put in a basement small room with no window I asked to change it Carpet in the room old looking dirty Lift not reaching the last floor 2ramps of narrow stairs ok with no luggage Breakfast very poor  Location,0
No Negative Great location close to centre but in a quiet neighbourhood Close to public transportation Schwedenplatz subway and tram station Stephan s Cathedral 15 min walk There is a supermarket next door The hotel staff are willing to help even before we arrived they sent the documents we needed within 30 min after the request Internet connection is fast and stable Breakfast from 6 to 11 am and the pastry was very good Some tasty cheese as well I can definitely recommend this hotel to other traveleres and would love to stay there next time I am in Vienna ,1
 we were completely dissapointed that although I am a Priority card holder we have asked for a late check out at 16 00 and they asked 80 euros extras They told us that they have availability but they need an Extra fee No Positive,0
 Small room with 50 x 80 cm window in far corner and without view Too windy and cold in the room The hotel is very proud with it s historical building but it should be renovated half a century ago Too overpriced breakfast is poor  Free minibar includes 2 bottles of beer and 2 bottles of vine several beverages Coffee machine did nor work at breakfast but waiter brought me espresso from the bar ,0
No Negative Good location only 20mins walk through Hyde Park to the concert 5min to the tube stations Comfortable clean room would stay again ,1
"Small room , lousy view , not quite clean bed linen , bathroom small & old fittings , general scruffy state of room & hotel interior . However if you need a mid town hotel just to sleep in & get a good price then it might not be the worst.",0

No Negative Nice building great location and very affichent staff ,1
 The check in was very impersonal we were given no direction as to where things were in the hotel no breakfast times or check out times Although free the WiFi was inconsistent and the beds had no mattress toppers meaning they weren t very comfortable We were 2 women in 2 rooms they allocated one on the 1st floor and the other on the 11th floor  Hotel is in a good location right on Embankment opposite the Houses of Parliament and less than a 10 minute walk from Underground stations ,0
 there was hairs in the bathroom the curtains didnt actually close properly and the noise was just so bad the room was far too hot it was big and it was clean the staff were ok,0
 Very tired rooms Need some serious refurbishment The carpet was so stained I didn t like to walk on it without shoes Location very good and reception staff helpful albeit a little slow ,0
 Very small rooms we had a superior room so I cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms Also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms Not so close from Kings Cross about 20 min walk TV not working Staff did not repair it over 2 days but they offered us a discount on the room Fair enough  Surely the refurbished rooms are modern and tastefully decorated,0
 No real bad experiences worth mentioning other than there is such a small bar for such a large hotel so you can have a wait if wanting a drinking late evening Also we took an executive room but didn t get the bottle water bathrobes and slippers which are what make exec over superior Didn t complain but mentioned at checkout so got parking for free instead happy days  Great location friendly staff good sized rooms parking available on site ,1

No Negative Everything was perfect,1
 The pool was clear but unfortunately it wasn t completely clean but it is situated right by trees so this is bound to happen For a four star hotel I expect a little bit more attention to certain things but it is all minor detail  Very nice welcome and they changed our room without any problems when I mentioned we d requested a double and not twin Overall it was a good welcome and a nice stay The pool was a nice temperature The room was clean and we had booked at last minute deal so it was great value for money The rooms are air conditioned and we had control over it ,1
 very small room very small and hard bed not for a couple too hot iniside rooms staff very attentive and friendly location close to metro and city centre very good for making tourism modern style of hotel,0
 I like to sleep fairly high so asked for an extra pillow was told they didn t have any Air con was very noisy The room described as Queen sized must have been one of those really small queens But apart from that much like any travel lodge style hotel nothing special but ok for a stay in central London  It was adequate and a great location handy for London Bridge and attractions ,1

"I came in very late one night and had a reservation through Hotwire and apparently Hotwire did not give payment information to the hotel and they said I owed for the night. I had prepaid through Hotwire, but Keith, the clerk got on the phone with Hotwire and while he was on hold he figured out what happened and was kind enough to bring me out from the cold while I waited and took my bag to the room. This isn't a four star hotel, but I had four star service.",0

No Negative Fantastic room for a family A very busy hotel with lots of facilities although you never felt like it was full as the room was amazingly quiet ,1
 Water would drain from basin without lifting pop up waste up using finger nails Three days of complaining before it was repaired Also bathroom door handle continually fell off as the screw at the side was missing and as it took so long to fix basin I didn t even bother my holiday was too short to waste it on complaints I just wouldn t go back or recommend it  Hotel location fab easy to access all popular sites Super comfy beds ,0
 Staffs are great friendly and helpful Rooms are tiny Curtains are dusty and dirty Bathroom sink leaks no air condition so rooms were very hot that we had to stay out till after midnight The compound is nice and relaxing in the evening but very noisy in the morning with loud noises from kids and lots of banging More like a 2 stars We did not get any rest  Price is slightly cheaper than most in Paris ,0
 Elevators are old and rickety Room air conditioning was not good Wifi would not connect Bathroom tap did not shut off properly No fridge in room  Location to Canary Wharf was good Hotel was very clean Supermarket situated nearby ,0
 The food in the bar attached to the restaurant was terrible and not really representative of previous reviews The food was almost inedible we refused to pay it was that bad Also its further away from the airport than is indicated more like 20 25 minutes on the shuttle painful early in the morning  Clean quiet bedroom ,0
 Crowded like a refugee camp and dusty like a moon crater Overall it feels like a 3 surely not 5 Dull breakfast Super tiny rooms with bleak design I could understand this size provided hotel was on the Dam Square But here My conclusion is never to come back to this place irritating in every aspect  One thing on the upside you still could get a free umbrella here ,0
 Room very small and cramped Broken floor tiles in bathroom with sharp edges  Location convenient to underground system ,0
 the metro station was far away from the one mention in the booking com instead of that exist enother metro station nearest When we arrive we had to carry the laggagies until the next metro station When eating breakfast i didn t like to see the cupboards in the kitchen and smell kitchen liquids The kitchen door shoulded me closed No Positive,0
"Somewhat distressingly, I was in an upgraded room. Much of the furniture is old, there is an obvious mildew issue, and you're close enough to the airport to have trouble sleeping (and I am a sound sleeper) due to the RUMBLE from the airplanes. Parking is cheap but you have to pay, it's behind a fence with a lot of other hotels.
The good note is that the staff is friendly, nice, effective, and, well, quite good. They were the high point of this hotel, to say the least.
The hotel restaurant is barely there, but there are several other hotel-captive restaurants across the parking lot, and although I didn't use any, I suspect they would be acceptable. I'm giving this one a thumbs down, that may change after the full renovation is finished.
Great staff, though.",0

 I made the booking but our friends got the room upgrade  The rooms are well designed and the bed was very comfy,1
 The property was undergoing renovations which I should have been informed about Paint smell in the room was awful The beds were terrible just above roller beds It was too hard to get into bath post heart surgery to take a shower they need to be seperate Breakfast was very poor quality Pastry s were stale and who serves baked beans at a hotel Ewww  Location close to Hyde park and tube Staff were lovely and working under very poor conditions,0
 Executive room was more expensive but it s the same size as a standard double and that is fairly small Shower not powerful and bathroom is also very small  Good location Clean room with comfortable bed Breakfast was good ,1

"If you see a deal for this hotel, you should run, not walk away from it. I got a deal for $-- a night from Hotwire, and really they should have paid me. The hot water in my room was spotty at best. The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free newspapers"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" they advertise? Yeah right, I think they plop two of them in the lobby. Breakfast was okay, not fantastic and pretty sparse, but the woman that cleans up in there is fantastic and really nice, I can't figure out why she works there. The pool I thought i could get some laps in. Umm... it was disgisting. It looked like an oil slick on top. The workout room? Two machines facing the hallway so you could put on quite a show for anyone who walked past. 
Save youself some grief, pay a bit extra and stay somewhere else.",0
 Nothing Upgraded room under floor heating in the bathroom ,1
"had three to a room requested - beds and got one bed with pullout bed instead- pullout mattress terrible, attitude from staff poor, requested late checkout got only --minutes more, bill was incorrectly calculated - times and then turns out they were billing it to another guests credit card number!!! at over --- dollars a night, I expected a lot more",0

 When I arrived at 10 30pm the double room I had booked 129 was not available had been double booked and I was offered a single 129 with a so called free breakfast even though I knew the breakfast was normally 19 so they were actually ripping me off Eventually they agreed 109 with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so I had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed The cooked breakfast was good quality though poor value for money 19,0

 The staff are so rude and would never stay here again The hotel was clean and well looked after ,0
No Negative Clean and very good decorated minimal design Near the Metro station to reach city centre and very friendly staff ,1

 The noise from hotel construction woke us up early 3 days in a row The gym facility was not large enough for more than one or two people at a time The location was very central but also very raucous We requested the firmest pillows available and they still were not firm enough to prevent neck pain  I loved being welcomed with a tin of stroopwafels The staff was always friendly and helpful We were happy with the cleanliness and security of the hotel ,0
 staff was not really nice they had to change our room because it was not big enough for one extra bed and baby bad what we have asked before coming so it was disaster we had to wait too much to come in our room room service is external so is just available until 23 hours and they didn t warn us  location was super,0

No Negative We liked the upgrade,1
"Pros: location is fabulous. Walking distance to the market, space needle, malls, shopping, etc. Neat offers incl. $--night if you waive cleaning service (can't be used at the bar). Rooms are pretty basic, but very clean. Offered some sweet views of the city. Gave us free snacks when we were having a drink in the lobby (little things count)! Great value since we got this as a mystery hotel from Hotwire and I think it worked out to $----night. 
Cons: Free wifi only offered in lobby. Kind of lame when you're on the --st floor like I was. A small coffee from Starbucks apparently goes for $- if you order from the rest., $-- for large (not kidding-Starbucks is around the corner).",0
No Negative Everything was perfect ,1
 The reception when we first arrived We had to wait outside and ended up knocking on a window to get inside then felt like we were disturbing them from whatever they were doing in the side room by the reception Almost made us want to leave  Location and the staff and cleaners Nice quiet room Really the difference was the staff on duty After the first evening we were doubtful but the other staff were truly exceptional and made our stay that much better Every day we bumped into cleaners and they were so kind and friendly ,1
 Nothing we can think of  Central location for southbank westend and waterloo station for trains to from Gatwick airport Spacious room great restaurant choices and bar Value for money Staff very friendly check in and check out procedure very efficient Will definitely go back if we can find a similar deal again ,1
"Great location. interesting entrance. Rooms great. -st guests in room, Spa has great view from top floor, Not enough elevators to handle the busy weekend of Cubs Fans!!!",1
"...and in need of a major refresh. Spent four nights there last week and every staff person I encountered was pleasant and service-oriented, but the layout of the place is odd and the entire atmosphere gives you a sense that you're back in the ----'s; old furnishings in the common areas, dingy colors and sleeping room decor that's bland as can be. It's not a dowtown hotel but it definitely charges downtown-type rates. The place is clean, it's very close to the light rail line and it's connected to a very good health club-gym that serves as the hotel's fitness center. But if I return to Phoenix I would definitely choose a different hotel. Poor value for the dollar.",0
 Nothing on this trip  Everything was spot on this visit the best stay I ve had ,1
"I travel very often to San Diego and this hotel is the worst I've experienced. To start, there were bed bugs in my room. Service at the bar-restaurant was awful, you'll be lucky to see a barman behind the bar. Staff was not very friendly, in one occasion I needed to break a couple of dollars for the washing machine and they were only able to find - quarters as there was no change in the bar. There is only one washing machine for guests, which is not ideal when you are on a long stay. Very poor overall.",0
 The condition of the room is APPALLING Design of bathroom terrible So uncomfortable to be in the room The walls were marked Shelf in bathroom falling apart and no where comfortable to put toileletries for two people not even for one no drawers or shelves to put cloths Hardly any room to move What a shame as it really spoiled the good standards of other Eurostars hotels we stayed at The breakfast was so poor and non tasty I have never tasted such bad scrambled eggs in my life  staff were very helpful and spoke good English They helped when required ,0
"Went there for business, staff was amazing as usual. Hotel looks great and location is perfect. Highly recommended and will return soon.",1

 The lift was out of order on the night we stayed We were going to Eventime Apollo and this was a great place to stay The hotel was delightful We had a lovely loft room which had character and which was spotlessly clean quiet and comfortable I would recommend this hotel ,1
 Some staff a little abrupt Wine stocks were very low Bathroom wasn t private enough for my liking and if light was switched on during the night it would disturb my husband as it lit up the room The water bottles in room were far too small  Location was good Our room was quiet at the back of property Buffet was good ,1
No Negative Amazing complimentary cookies beautiful top floor bar lounge with a great view and great location ,1
 The hotel is awful Decoration awful and health and safety an issue I m not sure there was anything Location was good,0

No Negative Great Location walking distance to Hyde Park Friendly and professional staff Well maintained facility ,1
 too small lift  Excellent location,1
 The bathtub was a bit short the heater noisy tv sound crap and the bed too firm for my liking I was shown where the light switchs are lol Everyone was so nice and I like the decor I came in before check in time and was upgraded so I don t wait and left after checkout time and they didn t say anything ,1

No Negative The eggs are good but the cheese assortment is poor ,1
 The bed was incredibly uncomfortable really hard There was only twenty minutes of free Wifi which wasn t very good anyway The breakfast was overcooked and of a cheap quality No Positive,0
 Compact room Friendly staff convenience location to station food and some of the tourist places,1
 Terrible plumbing in bathroom caused room to be flooded with water very terribly stink in bathroom even though I asked hotel reception to do something about terrible rooftop pool quality with obvious outdated finishes that looks old no basic amenities for coffee and tea which I have to pay for and caused Inconvenience terrible bar selection room way too small and bad layout with bedroom and bathroom having virtually no partition staff reception very inconsistent some are good some are bad Terrible value for money for the couple days we stayed in especially four stars rating Not recommended  Location and access to mall and metro ,0
 1 Considering the high level of this hotel at this high price there should at least be complimentary drinking water in the room 2 The room is missing on some of the most basic stuff such as towel hanging rack a decent one Also not enough lightings in the room very dark 3 Breakfast variety is not up to proper standard and the taste is quite bland  Good location very close to London Eye and the Big Ben ,0
No Negative Gorgeous hotel Charming and the best location ever Chic but a bit pricey ,1
 The breakfast was probably the worst European breakfast I ve ever had Amongst a tray full of bacon fat and a few chopped hot dogs they regularly had no coffee which was tasteless no water or juice Asking the waiters waitresses to fill these up were your only hope The bar had only 1 member of staff which took 20 minutes to be served he tends to like to serve 5 people at once then forgetting what it is he is supposed to be doing The price of a 400ml Beer Moretti is 7 which is dearer than some central places The hotel also doesnt provide an iron so if you ve bought yourself a nice outfit and have packed it like any other human be prepared to walk round Milan with creased garments  The bed was comfy room was generally clean ,0
No Negative Though the room was small but the interior designer arranged it quite well making the room cosy Friendly and service focused staff,1
 To tourists from the US where every hotel room has an iron and an ironing board it may come as a surprise that there is nothing like this here and you cannot even request an iron to use in your room When we asked front desk we were told that a maid can iron garments one for free and everything above that for a fee Even then after we did leave a request with the front desk maid never showed up So we had to go to Teatre alla Scala in wrinkled dress and shirt  The location is very convenient rooms are comfortable breakfast is excellent Staff is nice and very responsive to quesions and requests ,1
 The staff were rude and unhelpful The room cleaning was terribly mediocre and the interiors were always dusty even after the room was supposedly cleaned I found hair in the bathtub on my check in although we waited for 5 hours for the room to be ready and cleaned We arrived ta 8 30 AM to the hotel and we got the room at 1 30 PM The location is excellent since it is 1 min walk from Gloucester station ,0

 There was nothing I didn t like  The whole stay was great friendly staff lovely breakfast warm temperature throughout the room and very comfortable It was within close proximity of the venues we were visiting Ideal for couples to get away and relax I would stay again ,1
No Negative We enjoyed the swimming pool The room was very quiet ,1
 Receptionists need to be friendly especially the ones working night shifts name Alfonso They ignore customers and chitchat by themselves instead of paying attention to customers standing in front of them  Rooms were comfortable Bathroom needs to be improved ,0
 Lots of equipment in disrepair For a hotel advertised at a 4 star level the attention to detail is lacking and equipment is less than expected House keeping services is not consistent  Location is fantastic Staff are helpful and great It seems that they have limitations on what they can do to improve the experience ,0
 Cleaning can be better breakfast need to be improved Friendly staff location,1
 The rooms lack comfort you d expect at this price we stayed on the 7th executive floor especially a shower instead of a bath a tiny and chilly bathroom being stingy with toiletries a plastic can of gel stuck to a wall no cotton pads or anything No kettle  Various and well organized breakfast quiet room comfortable bed plenty of tv channels in a selection of languages friendly and helpful staff great english at the reception right across the metro station ,1
 The staff were not at all friendly and quite abrupt  Lovely modern room well decorated and comfortable beds Large double shower too ,1

 Bad service in room cleaning 2 days out of 5 no bath cleaning Our room has a view in town and boat for Mallorca left port every night at 23 30 noisy Rather expensive not value for money hotel  The hotel is located in the heart of the port It has a great nice location for starting your day around Barcelona Plenty of space in rooms Excellent personnel to assist you in anything Nice roof bar with beautiful view of the city especially at night Many buses urban and local are 50m away and also boat for Mallorca Ibiza Whatever you need just tell the personnel and it is done Even tickets for Barcelona FC Strong WiFi everywhere in the room ,0
 Cotton blankets instead of duvets for those of us who get too hot Boiled eggs soft and hard for breakfast  Helpful and attentive staff Vanessa at the front desk was great Breakfast good with plenty of options,1
 The room was very small  The staff was very friendly and the lounge was good ,1
 The room I don t like it Location is great Staff are very helpful and coapritive,0
 Would have liked poached or fried eggs  Scrambled eggs were poor Fruit tasted like left over from the day before the pineapple was certainly on the turn and left a bad taste in my mouth ,0
"You have to stay at this hotel if you are visiting San Fran. It is beautiful and has such wonderful history. There are a older part and a newer tower - I recommend staying in both areas of the hotel. It's right in the heart of Union Square - with access to shopping, and walking distance to many sites and locations.",1
 nothing Cleanness location and beds,1
No Negative We liked the excellent position in the heart of Soho the friendly staff and comfortable bed ,1
 Maybe a better coffee set up in the room Even though they offer nice coffee downstairs during breakfast my wife and I still need just one cup of coffee or espresso before leaving the room  Great location Close to metro Really nice and simple breakfast every morning downstairs just next to the lobby ,1
"I stayed here recently with some girlfriends. The location is perfect, right on Union Square, the rooms are very comfortable and clean and the fridge is very useful. The only thing missing is an ipod dock which is standard in most good hotels. The hotel charges for wifi which is unnecessary and annoying ! 
 The staff are all friendly and helpful.",0
 There could have been better selection in the mini bar Lifts were very small  Room so were beautiful location excellent Spotlessly clean Staff were pleasant My children s room even had a view of The Eiffel Tower ,1
 The room was a bit small but very clean  Hotel is situated very close to central London Makes it quitre easy for shopping and to view places of interest ,1
 Booking com gave a price of 190 when I started the booking process but I ended up paying 260 for the first night and then 290 for an additional night I booked shortly afterwards This is truly outrageous and customer service of the worst kind  Location,0

 Cost of breakfast Location,1
 The view from the window was pigeon nests and muck The bedroom was clean and modern with good facilities,0
 Basement room was the noisiest room I ve ever stayed in The noise from upstairs all night was horrendous and in the morning when breakfast started it was even worse  Location Only a few minutes walk from the tubexperts ,0
 Hotel is nice and classic style whcich is nice but needs to be updated for example the rugs and the door in our room allowed light from outside  Location was great unfortunately they re working on the tram rails so too noisy ,0

No Negative Excellent location and very comfortable and clean room ,1
 Nothing No,0
 Traveled in February the room and the lobby are extremely hot and stuffy Very uncomfortable to sleep at night Asked if there is a way to put air or fan on was told that no air and no fan can be put on at this time The front desk suggested I keep the window open which is a ridiculous comment since the window has no screen and keeping the window open and drapes closed would not help the situation Very uncomfortable at night  Good location friendly and helpful stuff,0
 Needs a renovation beds were not that comfortable feels very dated  Its was close to the Olympia centre ideal location if you are going to an exhibition ,0
 Quite bad reception service wrong information about restaurant forgotten shuttle booking generally quite uninterested with the customer needs Very expensive breakfast and bar Fixed the broken AC the same day big room big bed microwave in the room quiet neighborhood,0
 The week of the 3rd of October 2016 the room was cold and when I asked why I was told the hotel had not turned on the heating yet  Food particularly a curry ordered from the restaurant was very good ,0
No Negative Small and elegant like a big family home ,1
No Negative Chearful welcoming Helpful reception and staff,1
 It was a soul less box When I arrived I thought I had walked into the reception of an office building This hotel has no atmosphere Luckily you are so close to the Gothic quarter that you can walk a couple of minutes to get atmosphere in the bars and restaurants Simple things like shower gel would be appreciated and are expected at this price  Great location,0
Over-rated hotel and everything associated with the rooftop bar is low class. Wouldn't want you to experience what we experienced.,0
 The room was very tiny not what I was expecting at all I had half of an interconnecting room it was really noisy  The vibe of the hotel is great very trendy ,1
 No shampoo and method of calling lift  Large room nice smelling toiletries,0
 Poor check in process kept waiting for a long time and was in a hurry Not enough front office staff at a busy check in time This first impression reflects the overall feeling of the hotels efficiency Location,1
No Negative Very well located hotel friendly staff spotless room with fantastic shower would stay again all at a reasonable price,1
 Rooms are a bit too old It gets very noisy at night as the hotel is located on a very hype and dynamic street with lots of cafe s and restaurants Breakfast had very few varieties  The staff members are very friendly and helpful The heated pool is absolutely awesome and a great place for kids to relax and blow off some steam ,0
 i dont like breakfast need more various i like the room and toilets balcony ,1
No Negative All the staff were friendly and efficient without exception The room small double was small but well equipped comfortable and stylish I loved the fur throw and the slightly surreal illuminated book spines the recharging points and extra cables were a nice touch The bathroom was pristine and the shower was enormous The teeny kitchenette was just what we needed and I wish my sink at home looked as shiny though a dishcloth might have helped me leave it tidier We asked for a quiet room and it really was quiet no disturbances at all honestly the most peaceful night s sleep I have ever had at a hotel This was an exploratory visit we were sizing the place up for a possible return to a Nadler with our child and dog and it certainly convinced us to do this ,1
 mini fridge wasn t available  Amazing staff ,1
 Tiniest bathroom toilet ever  Very comfortable bed,1
 The room was very small was not as expected for a 4 hotel The area around the hotel was very noisy very early in the morning we were situated at the rear of the hotel so it was not due to traffic noise but more likely deliveries to the hotel  Staff were friendly Area offered plenty of restaurants it was in easy reach of the underground ,0
 Rooms were noise Location room service and private car park was excellent,1
 Nothing to dislike as it was indeed a pleasant stay even though  The bed was comfy and the space within the room is sufficient for our family The design is modern and it s clean The bathroom has a good space and my kid loved the bath tub of course The location is great We could go on foot to tower bridge etc It s next to the mind boggling Borough market despite the unfortunate incident The underground is near and we could travel further conveniently Staff were helpful ,1
 Room Nothing special,0
No Negative Love a bath Also very large comfy bed very clean ,1
 Room was very basic and outdated There were stains on the headboard and the air con made the room feel damp No tea or coffee making facilities in the room no fridge Arrived back at the hotel at around 2 30am and had to wait to be let in by the night porter which took a while  Good central location without the expensive central price tag Friendly staff,0

No Negative Perfect location just a few bus stop from city centre Stylish and comfortable hotel at a very reasonable price ,1
 Rooms small but serviceable Lift a tight fit for two people and suitcases  Near Buckingham Palace Helpful staff Doorman age old service you don t see too much of these days ,1
 Remote control for the TV was missing not important though Somehow some devices were some kind of noisy not loud but at night they were going on and or off  Not in the center center but reachable easily by train via Sloterdijk or Tram ,1
 Breakfast is too expensive to the quality  It was clean and nice enough and not too far from tour spots,0
 Nothing Location outstanding Hotel rooms big clean well equipped Julian his team are fantastic I have stayed in many hotels around the world this team are by far the best Nothing too much trouble always great advise,1
 I didn t like when ordering room service I specifically said no mayonnaise in my sandwich which then arrived with maynoasie in I phoned to tell them and they offered to come collect it and change it however at this time it would of taken another half hour so I asked for a refund They come to collect the sandwich and the waiter was very very rude and said it s my fault and they shouldn t be refunding it I even advised him to go listen to the call so I could prove I was not in wrong very poor service and let down the whole stay for me and my partner  I loved at first how every member of the staff including the cleaning staff were poilite and made you feel welcome ,1
 Breakfast was chaos Both mornings we could not find seats and had to wait in line for coffee up to 20 mins Food was average They can improve it by allocated seating rather than letting people seat wherever they want Location was about 25mins by tram away from the hub of the city Great staff in the bar Bed was comfortable and rooms were clean,1
 No bad experiences  Loved the location atmosphere and great service A great hotel directly on Leidseplein ,0
 the bed is uncomfortable bed sheets are like hard paper and the AC is just over your head It isnt a 4 star hotel maybe a 3 The pool area is tiny and there is no option to just relax on the roof You are either sitting at the bar or dip in the pool There is no lounge area Staff is very fake friendly I love Barcelona but there are much better hotels than this one NOT RECOMMENDED and overpriced  not a 4 star hotel maybe 3 The rain shower is cool tho Location is good as well ,0

 Our room certainly did not resemble any of the ones pictured It was dark gloomy and was at basement level I booked a family room for myself husband and daughter based upon the photographs on the website I would not choose a dark windowless room for my daughter to sleep in and was relieved we were in and out of there prior to the warmer days as I believe it would have been very unpleasant in the airless rooms The shower nozzle was constantly falling off and hitting us on the head The water temperature constantly changed from hot to cold  The hotel was convenient for our stay in London It was easy to find ,0
 The Booking Com profile suggested that the hotel had parking When I arrived at the hotel I was told by the receptionist that there was a place reserved for me in a private car park down the street When I was checking out the next day I was informed that the parking was nothing to do with the hotel It cost me an extra 40 euro I knew from the reaction of the receptionist that this was not the first time that this problem had arisen It us a complete scam The lift was not working in the hotel and we had to haul our bags up 5 flights of stairs  Central location ,0

 Nothing We had an absolutely fantastic stay at the hotel brilliant value for money Its not close to London central about 15 20mins on the tube There is a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent buses and just a short walk to the tube station Its across from london designer outlet which has plenty a bargin and good selection of resturants Staff were very helpful and welcoming The hotel itself has to be one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in and that s saying a lot as I am really fussy Breakfast was lovely and plentyful Had an evening meal one of the days which was also lovely We have already booked to go back ,1

I asked for a change & was then given a room with a view of a parking lot, close to the Petco Ball Park, which was even worse, because I had to listen to the sounds of the ballgames. Then, at -:-- AM, I was awoken by the surprisingly loud shower of a neighboring room. Also, the lobby was bedlam, the bedspread was soiled & the carpet worn. I checked out.",0

 It was quite far from the centre but the tram 2 line was a couple minutes away and took you straight to anywhere you could want to go was very regular I d recommend planning out how to get to places before you go though  The staff at the hotel were so helpful and welcoming throughout our stay keeping hold of our luggage printing off tickets for us etc The facilities were great especially for the price we paid and the spa was definitely worth the extra The 24 7 shop in the lobby was also a lifesaver for forgotten items and late night snacking ,1

"This was ok. The room was good in size for -, it would be very small for -! The bathroom was filthy (I cleaned it myself) but the rest of the room was ok. The reception and door staff always pleasant. The concierge and bell boy - not so at all! The location is right om time square (you come out right on top of the half price ticket booth), so a good central location - although very busy and impossible to get a cab. I think I would stay more out of the centre if I was to return. Overall just ok.",0
 Front end staff can be very cold And hotel a bit too far from the underground not that its your fault  The staff at the breakfast room are amazing Genuinely love serving people Same goes for the concierge,0
 They have a beautiful lounge bar on the roof that has an awesome view of the basilica But the wait staff of one up there is TERRIBLE The jewel of this hotel is that terrace and it is set up with1 guy that is way over his head That s the way it was during our stay We complained to the front desk about it Incompetent We know there were others that had this issue as well terrible  Very nice hotel Affordable for the weekend but a little more than we wanted to pay Very close to La Segrada Familia Great view lounge on top of the roof that looks right at the La Segrada Familia Comfortable bed and room very clean Vibrant and modern The front desk staff was great very helpful ,1

Stayed on the --nd floor. View was directly over the WTC site. Room was a great size. King size bed, desk, and chair. Good size bathroom. Room was alittle warm despite turning off the heat. We were able to open the windows which did help alot. 
Hotel is a few blocks away from several subway stops. It was in walking distance to South Street Seaport ... about ---- blocks. Hotel is around the block from St Pauls Cathedral and Century --. Did not find much nightlife or places to dine around the hotel.",1

 Everything is just too small I couldn t use the bathroom comfortably because the toilet was small It sat in the gap between the shower screen and sink unit and there simply wasn t enough space for comfort This was a big put off  The hotel has a nice lobby which is a nice arrival A delicious warm cookie given on check in which was a nice touch Room service was high quality ,0
 Property is cheap old rundown and not what it says it is  Would never refer it to anyone,0
"Lovely indoor pool area, looks like a lodge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, very comfortable and spacious, with minimal noise from outside (you could hear planes, but only if you really listened for them). The breakfast buffet was good value with great coffee (Starbucks), but the omelet chef did not have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I got more of a scramble than an omelet, and he might have put all of three spinach leaves in the whole thing, which cooked down to nothing. I booked a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cars eat free"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" package which included parking and a $-- gas card - if they still have this deal it is worth it. Overall a very good experience.",1

"We had made a phone reservation at a weekend rate. As we went to pay they changed the rates and ended up paying double for the second night. The staff was not helpful at all, they told us that the rates were subject to change and that, in fact they had changed because it was marathon weekend. The room was very basic, small and ot comfortable, towels very small. Absolutely not worth the price.",0
 N A Lovely comfy bed great cocktails AND lovely staff ,1
 Scanty breakfast To NOT get flaky croissants and fresh coffee in Paris is a huge let down The size of the rooms is shockingly small so always best to pay a little extra and get the balcony room especially if you re a smoker  Walking distance to Metro 24 hour reception is always useful Hotel staff helpful about guiding you around the area A laundrette down the road is very handy The small but well stocked corner store operated by your friendly Moroccan family is open 24 7 ,0

 Too much noise from the inside of the hotel it has a structural fault slamming doors that shake walls and bed flushing toilets from other rooms talking guests and screaming children can be heard all the time walls seem paper thin guests on the second floor could hear and feel metro passing under the hotel I felt it in in the shower 4th floor etc If you want to get a good night s rest do not go to this hotel Windows are well isolated you cannot hear anything from the street Plus the pool is by far not as big as it seems on the photos the photos are a pure lie in this regard  Very friendly staff clean and nice looking rooms ,0

 1 Few staffs were very friendly but some are super impolite 2 I have strong opinion about the broken promise offered by the hotel the requirement of two single beds was mentioned clearly on couple weeks ago it is seemed invisible On the other hand the staffs deal with this without any apologies Shameful 3 Letting the customers to live in the harmful smell room newly renovated what do you want really ridiculous The worst services I have ever seen in Europe No Positive,0

"The hotel is clean and modern, but the location is very inconvenient for business in downtown San Diego. As others have noted, it is a good $-- cab ride away from anywhere. As seems typical for a Sheraton, nothing is included. Internet? $$$ (Nobody could give a reasonable explanation as to the difference between the basic and enhanced version!) Breakfast? $$$. Apart from that, they seem to take advantage of their captive audience by inflating the charges for everything on offer. For a quick stay before flying, sure, but otherwise there must be better choices around.",0

Nothing else about the hotel really sticks in my mind, negative or positive, save for the ridiculously tight parking garage. I was most definitely happy to have a very small car. I'm honestly not quite sure how some of the gargantuan SUVs even got into the garage.",0

 The service received in the adjoining restaurant Crown Grill was appalling and I complained to the restaurant manager and the Clayton Crown Hotel check out staff I ordered a 3 course meal and every item served was different to what I ordered For example I ordered a crab salmon soufle starter what arrived was smoked salmon and rocket served on a sourdough bread I ordered a corn fed roast chicken with a green salad and herb garlic sauce main course what arrived was a roast chicken with a cream peppercorn sauce and chopped carrot salad I then ordered a raspberry brulee desert what arrived was a vanilla brulee topped with a strawberry My bill was reduced by 2 94 which I thought rubbed salt into the wound  Easy to understand air conditioning controls ,1
 restaurant in hotel very expensive Staff in restaurant very ugly servis main restaurant  Location is perfect for shopping,0
 nothing every thing i good,1
 Room could have had better air conditioning quite frankly I don t think it was working at all The wall panel setting indicated 13 deg which would be like the north face of the Eiger yet it felt like the tropics so no I don t think it was working and I ended up opening the windows which meant quite a high level of ambient noise This is not a real negative but i will mention it anyway the TV remote control was infuriatingly slow and made it was quite difficult to select a channel accurately  The room was quite small but very functional and very clean However I would suggest the size of the room is fairly typical London offering Bed was superb lovely and comfortable in fact ,1

 Rooms on the small side but unless you spend a lot of time in your room which I suspect most people don t when they re in London then I would recommend Very friendly start with a welcome drink and comfy sofa to sit on instead of having to stand while waiting to check in Help with bags to the room Good attention to detail free wi fi welcome fruit basket and bottled water Very comfortable stay and close to two tube stations,1

 Overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally Location was not as convenient as expected and despite King s Cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about 10 GBP taxi fare away  This hotel did not suit me personally ,0

"The Room was clean but that is all. Lacks even the basics of a hotel (ie: towel rack, shower mat, waste backet, hangers, bedspreads or window curtains.) Try to imagine the ugliest room in the ugliest building in the ugliest neighborhood you can imagine, and you will have an idea of the Cadillac Hotel. We felt safe enough in the hotel, but the neighborhood is mostly street people living out of shopping carts. Would have been expensive for half what we paid ($--- including tax) when we stayed on August -, ----.",0

"This hotel is pretty decent - usual breakfast, free wifi, good spacious rooms. One thing I feel they should improve is cleaning - there were carpet stains as well as stains on the bath tub that was not cleaned well prior to our checking-in. 
Overall, this is a decent hotel for a couple of nights stay in Austin.",0
 Room was quite small narrow but the design around this was innovative and so no real problem Quirky modern boutique hotel in trendy location Very comfortable king size bed Didnt feel cramped despite the small room area Mood lighting in the bathroom was a nice feature Cleanliness excellent would definitely recommend this hotel There was a glitch with the IT which meant you couldnt watch a film on the tv Without any prompting we were given complimentary drinks and breakfast as an apology which was very generous considering I hadnt even complained ,1

Our room was a corner so we had - windows of sunshine and a view of the neighborhood streets.
Tip: Expedia charged more than the Ramada website (weekdays $--)
Tip: If there is - thing this hotel could improve, it's the towels. If you need fluffy, thick towels to dry your hair, bring one of your own. If you don't care, don't worry, it's fine.
Transportation: cabs always available. Take healthy walks to Union Square or Times Square, - train is close by or further up is Grand Central Station. Take the M----M----M--- bus down to the Lower East Side.",1

Thie staff is horribly rude parking is first come first serve the bed are uncomfortable. They allow scalpers to conduct business in the lobby. All in all it was the worst hotel I have ever been to I would prefer motel -. I strongly urge you not to ruin your vacation stay else where.,0
"We stayed in the Cova Hotel in S.F. for three nights during our West Coast road trip in June ----. The hotel lies in Tenderloin, which isn’t the best location in S.F, but you can reach almost every S.F. attraction walking. We saw some drug deals on the street and some people looked pretty aggressive. The hotel itself is clean (cleaned every day), rooms are spacious and staff is very friendly. There is free wifi on the hotel. 
Parking is pretty expensive, we payed about $--- for -- hours.",0

"What a value! For $-- got over a weeks worth of covered parking, free shuttles and a spacious suite!
Just parking at O'Hare for -- days was going to cost us more!
This hotel really is the absolute best parknfly option at O'Hare.
The room and bathrooms were very large. For a family with teenage daughters, all trying to get ready before our early flight, we could not have asked for more.
We have stayed at other ParknFly hotels near O'Hare, so we know what we are talking about here.
The pool was awesome, and the workout room has a window into the pool. So I could keep an eye on both of my girls, one swam and the other worked out.
The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""L"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is right across the street for easy access to Chicago.

 I paid for to have my room upgraded to a air condition room and that was way over charged for what was at best very poor working system if it was working at all the room was always warm This hotel would be fine in the winter or during cool weather but if the weather was hot it would be very uncomfortable Also for reason know only to the hotel the room bed had only a very heavy blanket on the bed with only the mattress sheeted so you only had one sheet not two as in most hotels  The hotel staff was very nice and helpful and when ever I needed help they helped me out ,0

 Having to sleep in a room with no air con and the only option to compensate this was an air cooler and a fan that was like trying to sleep in a box room with a jet engine Impossible to relax watch TV get ready in fact overall enjoy or short stay in London Absolute disgrace that this room was sold to us as the hotel was going under a renovation Feel conned by both Hilton and booking Com Even more so now that the Manager offered us a free up grade on our next visit Refused as this was just simply not good enough  Reception staff,0

"Horrible experience, from housekeeping, to the front desk, and most disappointing management. I stayed for - nights and only once got service although I requested it every morning. The room was nice but very noisy and it smelled like smoke although it's a non smoking property. The most disturbing thing was on my -nd night when front desk transferred a call to my room at -am! I didnt expect a call, didnt know who it was...i asked the front desk agent who was it and he said someone called to be transferred to the room. He didn't even ask for the name on the room.
At checkout i met the manager...i mentioned my issues with her and she offered a $-- discount for my almost $--- bill lol. Stay away, they don't care about their guests.",0

"We had planned to stay for a night before an early flight out of Memphis. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and the hotel seemed pleasant though older. However, our family (with young chidren) was harassed on the street walking in from the parking garage, and the empty buildings and empty liquor bottles on the streets around the hotel made us feel concerned for our vehicle as well as leaving in the dark the next day. Not the hotel's fault at all, but this is not an area you will want to walk around.",0

A beautiful converted pagoda that is a great place to go to with friends for a weekend of rest and relaxation. The rooms are comfortable and spacious and the villa itself is filled with beautiful antiques and furnishings. A lovely private pool to enjoy. A great destination that is so close yet you certainly don't feel like you're anywhere near the busyness of Ho Chi Minh,1
 room very small for the price Japanese restaurant closed on weekends bar closed before midnight on saturdays location is great base,1
 The double bed was two single beds on wheels which meant that it moved when we tried to sleep on it  I liked the location which was excellent right in the centre of everything,1
"If you need a place to sleep between planes, this place is okay. But everyone who works there seems to have an attitude. The shuttle driver was lackadaisical in getting to the airport - he was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on break"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but the main desk personnel didn't tell us when we called. They also seemed bothered by our desire to check in; seems it interrupted some really important conversation they were having with one another about the merits of Walmart. The restaurant staff also seemed mildly irked that we were disrupting their early morning conversation. All in all, their view seems to be, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We'll take your money, but we don't have to be nice about it."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Go with low expectations, and you won't be disappointed.",0

No Negative The room was clean and comfortable with a view over a quiet street lined with trees Although space was somewhat limited as other reviewers have mentioned this didn t affect the quality of our stay and we would come back again We had an excellent breakfast freshly squeezed orange juice and real coffee with strength and flavour A good range of food options and friendly service The staff were all polite and helpful and we were very happy with our stay at the hotel ,1
 swimming pool too small  excellent location very close to metro station and 10 mins walking from La Rambla Rooms very confortable and clean with all the needed furnitures Staff extremely professional and always available for any necessity ,1

"I visited this crap hole with my family. If the kids weren't so tired I'd never stayed until morning! Bath was nasty and water trapped under the plastic tube it a hazard. The water pushes up the tub, like standing on a waterbed. Very dangerous!!! The water that gushes up when you stand in the tub is putrid. Had to put a towel at the door to avoid the odor. Never again.",0

"I stayed here a week ago and the lobby of the hotel is nice. The room, workout facilities, and the rest of the hotel are in need of a decor update. The plumbing in my room did not work so well, but it functioned. I was a little aggravated that the leaking water on the bathroom floor. . The hotel smelled musty and overall looked worn in the interior. The frount counter clerks had trouble finding my reservaion and they seemed like they were too distracted to check me in. I am sorry to say all of this, but I am just being honest and I think this hotel needs to get their act together.",0

"Stayed in June ----, we used the house car twice, the - bedroom apartment was very nice and stylish, no body told us that they have bikes for guest use when we asked abou bikes to cross the Golden Bridge Gate, so we rented bikes for that trip.
The parking fee was so expensive $-- a day , we parked the car for - nights without using it once, since we were eager to use the cable car to go to and from Union square, and the F-line with historic buses from towns of USA and Europe. also we used the Yellow GO-Car once , which is a self-Guided tour in small yellow cars, went through Lombard street and Golden gate park in the Go-cart which was so much fun.",1
 Leaving to go home  Excellent location to La Rambla port area we stayed after arriving by cruise caught the shuttle bus from port to Mirador de Colom only stop then a short 5 minute easy walk to hotel Staff couldn t be more helpful Clean comfortable rooms Decent breakfast with enough choice to satisfy the pickiest eater ,1
"Stayed here for a very quick weekend in the end of February, not the best time to be in NYC, but this hotel made everything better. A very nice and comfortable room. We paid a little extra for a nice view and it was totally worth it. Great view of the Hudson and buildings around the --th Avenue area. An added bonus, every night they have a wine happy hour from ---pm, where the selected wine is free and all you can drink! I guess the only complaint would be the location, its a little bit of a cab ride to certain popular parts of the city, however it is close to Penn Station, so that's a plus. Overall, a great value and a really nice room. Did not try the restaurant, but it looked expensive.",1

"I have been on an extended business trip, and on the week of April --th, my wife came to visit me. We stayed at On The Avenue, on the upper West Side. What a treat. Quiet clean rooms in a user friendly area of Manhattan. We had especially memorable trip because of an employee who went beyond courtesy and service. His name is Dennis K., and he was the best at directions, helpful hints, and humor. Ask him to do a Brooklyn or New Jersey accent. Thank you Dennis, you made our trip memorable.",0
"We stayed - nights in early June. Upon check in, the clerk acknowledged that we prepaid for all six nights. We were subsequently charged again for all six nights. We complained and were told it would be taken care of, of course it wasn't. We complained again and finally it was corrected only to be charged again. We had a rental car and the charges for the parking were confused as well. After speaking to two different managers, all parking fees were removed. We were also promised a newspaper each day, and we never received even the first one. The room was just okay. On the plus side, the housekeeping staff was excellent. Overall, the hotel was really disappointing.",0

"What a dump. We had two rooms, and the floors were filthy in both rooms. The television in one room had to be replaced, the replacement worked for about five minutes. The fridge was dirty, coffee pot carafe was broken and the filter holder was broken. The room numbers for some of the rooms are writen with black marker on a piece of duct tape. The crabby man working the deck upon check-in didn't help either. The pool was filthy as well, and there were ants in the bathroom. The breakfast was good if you don't mind your bread toasted on one side.",0

 A room without a window is called a cupboard It should not even be legal and definitely not called a 4 stars hotel And when there is written on the booking description that the room has a view not having a window is a consumer fraud Eventually when a hotel mistakenly charges GBP 267 instead of 297 one can expect the customer to be informed that a mistake was made and that an additional GBP 30 will be charged before the additional charging happens No Positive,0

The room was nice although the bathroom was a little small. 
I will stay again at my next visit to New York.",1
 The location was poor for our needs as we met with friends who wanted to see the sights of London The transport links were close by but these proved tedious to get into central London We lost a lot of time in tube stations and felt that this spoiled the weekend The hotel staff and facilities were fine and just what you would expect from this chain of hotels,0

"Ok I'll start with pluses, great location, just beside times sq. free wifi in cafe across the road, near train and bus station if ilke us you want to go to Jersey Gardens-other discount places outside city. We used this as a base and just wandered up to Central Park, walking distance to Macys and almost everywhere. great buzz around the area. bars-restaurants are touristy nearby.
Hotel is fairly run down. Hot water was non existent for - days. Bed linen was worn. Not a place to bring your girlfriend. She'd be horrified! 
Cheap and cheerful and means you can spend your money on clothes, theatre and food!",0

Room and house keeping staff was excellent. Hotel restaurant: Food was excellent quality, average price for hotel restaurant. Wait service could have been better.

 The room was let down by little things such as the shower head not fitting correctly the annoying lighting system or noisy air con Also my room looked out across to other peoples room and felt that you could be seen the whole time Other little things such as the gym equipment being out of batteries or hoovers left in corridors meant there was a general feeling of shoddiness Staff in the bar were a bit slow and for 24 the breakfast was terrible  The hotel rooms were wonderfully quiet The location next to the Thames was scenic but not particularly convenient for the tube ,0

"My husband and I stayed in this hotel during a business trip. The location, on --rd St. and Lexington Avenue is incomparable. Our room had a queen sized bed. There was very little street noise on the --th floor. It was fairly small is is to be expected in NYC. It was also a little pricey which was to be expected. Although our reservation said internet service would be $--.---day, we were charged $--.--. Overall the room was reasonably clean but we opened the cabinet in which the refrigerator was enclosed and it was covered with dust. Also the bath tub drain which was covered in a prior guest's hair was left on the side of the tub. The front desk staff was a little haughty until I reported the tub hair. All in all, I'd stay at this hotel again.",0

 Food could be better The staff could take responsibility of complaints instead of declaring directly to our neighbors our complaints about loud music we felt a bit uncomfortable when we came back to the room It s better avoid asking people what they re going to do next it s none of your business in some case  Everything comfy and amazing place We loved the technology the bed and the bathroom shower The restaurant has a really nice view and the staff there was very caring We loved the fact reception is always available at any time for any needs and they were helpful and kind Overall it was a great stay with high standards and all the small things were highly appreciated ,1
 More shampoo and shower gel Amazing view from room,1
 The service in reception very bad To do check out had to wait twenty minutes Later i had to wait another 20minutes for the taxi When taxi arrived another client took it And it happened with the next one as well Anybody from the hotel took a resposability for wrong organization Consequently i lost a flight Way the staff behave is like in flew market being noisy And unpolite Seems like in the hotel there is missing discipline And organization The hotel needs still improve comparing with the competition My experience in this hotel Its definately bad No Positive,0
No Negative The bed was extremely comfy Staff couldn t do enough for us ,1
 But I found the staff to be a bit off and also the fire alarm went off which did disrupt us but we were given no apology I did enjoy the location,0
 On the second day at 4 00 PM the room was not cleaned When I asked for the cleaning service the lady in charge told me that she had other business to do Very rude The carpet needs a change asap For 350 euro at night we aspected more  Right in the city s center 20 meters from the Duomo di Milano ,0
 Being woken at 1am by housekeeping letting themselves into our room to deliver milk that we d asked for over an hour before and had given up on receiving  Excellent location and comfortable beds ,1

 Beeakfast is quite limited Same problem with shower gel as in many other hotels too small for one normal body Why shower gel has the same size as shampoo as we need much less liquid for washing hair  Impressive hotel with an amazing dining room which you should absolutely see one day Rooms very comfortable and calm offering all the luxury you need Next to Tower an London bridges abd to the very animated thames riverside ,1

 The bedrooms are pretty poor although our bed was very comfortable The position of the room below street level not great What spoiled the room most however was a toilet and shower in the room behind a partially opaque glass partition which did not reach the ceiling Never seen anything like this before  Breakfast was good and the facility for the sister hotel close to our point of departure to store our cases was much appreciated ,0
 We were changed on check in from the Mercure Kensington to Mercure Paddington without prior notice by email or phone Even though we had an Executive room it was very small we were joking on how cramped it was The train noise from the Paddington station was mildly annoying The last thing was that my wife asked for a hairdryer as the built in one didn t work and had to wait more than an hour with wet hair to have it delivered All that the reception staff was able to say was We re sorry Not good enough if I m paying a hefty rate to have good time in London  The bed was comfortable and the wifi was fast The bonus smartphone was a cool touch although we didn t use it ,0

No Negative Nice staff good location and value of money,1
 Smelly toilet and noisy at the early morning Location is perfect,0
 At first glance very modern unique design but the hotel is very small and I feel not made the most of the space and clutterd the area instead staff show some inexperience on how they deal with situations and the atmosphere is awkward sauna was closed when I wanted to use it something I really was looking forward to do and main reason I booked this hotel overall disappointing and a let down from the first look like a beautifully wrapped gift but the actual gift is not as good quality as it looks modern design spa facilities,0
 We booked for four people There were towels for only three people Shower products were also very few  The location and the rooftop terras with the beautifull view at the Eifeltower kind staff ,1
No Negative The staff were excellent Very friendly and accommodating The room was fabulous and the hotel is in a very good position for theatre land Chinatown or just for shopping ,1
 This is not a 4 star hotel In the room there is nothing extra no boiler no cooler Carpets in my room were old and dirty It is cheap hotel near city center Do not expect much Hotels personnel told me that theirs parking place is full and I had to wonder for half an hour to find any parking space in the city if you are coming with a car be careful  WiFi is working fine two elevators so I had never to wait good localization,0
 Booked a twin room but beds not separated before arrival and had to have guest services arrange No big deal but if you book a twin you expect a twin  Welcome cookie and lovely smell in reception Comfortable beds View from sky bar ,1

"We arrived mid-afternoon and got our room immediately. The room is somewhat small but for NYC its what I excpected. The room was very nice, bed was as comfortable as I've had a hotel. The room has a refrigerator so you can walk down the street - blocks to the Duane Reade Pharmacy and purchase water, pop, beer or snacks to keep in the room. Location is great. Reasonable walking distance to many attractions a short distance to -th St, Park Ave and Broadway. Hotel is on Lexington Ave and the #- subway train is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""the Lexington Line"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so you can catch it - blocks away at --st or - blocks away at Grand Central(--nd).

 If you stay in the other part of the hotel and park your car there you have to walk from the car park to your hotel as there is no direct access by lift  Location and good access to metro There are two buildings for the hotel so if you want a good view go for the tallest part which is around twenty three floors high with fantastic views from the restaurant at the top ,1

 No hot water in the bathroom the morning of departure Needed a doctor in the afternoon had to wait three hours Charged 30 extra rent to sit for an hour in a quiet lounge area by the bar  Friendly staff,0

 The room was very run down there was a pull out bed and we had twin beds even though we booked a double We were fobbed off with an excuse that they upgraded us to a bigger room Did the bigger room I want just a decent bed The carpet was disgusting and had cigarette burns in it The room smelled like smoke we struggled to sleep and their solution was to mask it with air freshener to make it even worse  Location close to US embassy shops and Royal Academy There was lots of hot water and water pressure was really good The guys on the concierge desk was the best this about this hotel ,0
 stressing breakfast I didn t finish with my breakfast and just went away for to take some more coffee 2 minutes later they had already clean my table and prepared for the next customer  Very nice Terrace Bar Restaurant staff was lovely,0

 Wish we were there longer Comfortable rooms ideal location special mention for the hot free cookies on arrival,1
 have recently broken my wrist so a walk in shower would have been better than bath shower combo also no water in room except mini bar and only 2 sachets of coffee bit stingy for such a classy hotel upgraded on arrival lovely room with fab bathroom,1
 We were originally given a room on the 1st floor at the end of a corridor It was noisy sounded like construction work next door The shower didn t work didn t switch from bath to shower We were changed to a room on the 8th floor I would be upset if I d paid more for this room as it was very similar to the one on the 1st floor In summary very disappointed with the stay The lady on reception didn t seem to appreciate why I was so upset and very reluctantly went to ask a manager for help It was a special treat weekend for us but it was spoiled by our experience at the Copthorne Tara  Location parking good ,0

 The hotel overall requires an update furniture is old and seen better days the bathroom was very small and badly stained bath i e soap scum the rooms were very dusty staff were either friendly or not attentive at all depending on shift  The location was the only great aspect of this hotel very central And the size of the rooms were decent ,0
 used the one chair for night stand not too comfortable the staff friendly,0
 I was charged 60 Euros for the 3rd person but the room was missing amenties for the Rd person such as towels cup and from the 2nd day onwards the toiletries were for 2 persons we brought this to the attention of the front desk but still missing extra cup and tea bags refilled The scent used in the lobby was chokingly repulsive which gave us headaches Not worth paying for a small room with such low customer service  Location,0
 The customer friendlyness of the staff The location and the bed,0

"We chose this Best Western because of the proximity to events. But I would not go back. First it is VERY dated. The walls and Windows do not keep out the sounds. Very small room. Had to move a chair to get in and out of the door. The bed was comfortable, that was a saving grace. To get your luggage to your room is a ordeal. One cart, no elevator from parking. The staff was very nice, decent cont. breakfast and the downstairs coffee was ok. If you plan to go deep sea fishing at from the landing. This is good. But next time, I would go Next door to the Holiday Inn Bayside. I went next door to check it out. They have a small store downstairs for water, beer, alcohol and small gifts.",0
No Negative clean comfortable room good shower helpful staff,1
"The hotel is ok. The room needed a better cleaned. The problem that we had wad the people at the front desk wasnt polite. I was doing my laundry in a locked room and when i came back, my clothes were all over the room. Someten at the frontdesk gave the spray key to 
other guest and he- she took my cloth away from the washer machine. Then while i was waiting inside the lobby some couple came in, but they didnt looked like a loving couple, it was more like a kittens were all around.",0
 I didn t find the staff helpful at all I hadn t been in that area before and asked a few staff for advice on where to go for eating and shopping There response was short and not very pleasant Breakfast was included in our stay but was cold and not tasty at all The hotel room was clean and spacious Good location for the work I was over for but not central if I was there for a leisure break ,0
 Internet sucked Room small and old It was okay the location was great,0

No Negative All of Greenwich right on the doorstep,1
"For a major hotel in a major city this is disappointing. Postage-stamp sized room, below average bathroom facilities, dingy and depressing lobby and hallway lighting. But the worst is the paper-thin walls. We listened to conversations in rooms on both sides of ours with no difficulty. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""High speed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" internet is a slow LAN network.
Stay somewhere else if you need to travel to Boston.",0
 I don t like the way the employees treat me I was really disappointed especially because was my honeymoon  The location only,0

No Negative Excellent location comfy bed friendly staff Wonderful hotel,1
 Staff seemed disinterested maybe because most of them barely spoke English The room was MUCH smaller than the pictures there was only just room for the double bed Also when we checked in the room was not ready no pillowcases on the pillows no towels etc The breakfast though good was served in a very small and crowded room  The hotel had a good central location at walking distance from Oxford Street Baker Street and the Underground Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean Breakfast included was pretty good ,0

 Do not book at this property absolutely no value for money Rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere Bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush Room sizes were extremely small for 2 people less than 6sqm which is beyond human We felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard Absolute catastrophe for a 4 star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area  The location is good but that s it ,0

 An extra blanket in the cupboard would have been nice  I liked it all really ,1
No Negative Very comfortable room in a good location for travellers we were staying overnight before taking the train to Switzerland The bistro was good if unadventurous but fine for a dinner after a long day The bathroom was confusing at first as the shower had glass panels that meant someone in the bedroom could see the person in the shower then we worked out there was a button that made the glass magically become opaque yes we all played with it Modern comfortable and undemanding accommodation ,1
 I had a sync clogged and told it 2 times to the portie But it was not fixed until my departure My colleagues booked a twin room And on arrival they tried to give them room with 1 bed Only when they told they are about to call booking they was given the right room The personnel does not speaks well English No breakfast I was staying there for exhibition in Olympia and for that it s a perfect place Literally 3 min walk And to the center of London food access by bus,0
 A bit more variety in the lounge bar would be great I couldn t get a proper whiskey or better any whiskey at the bar Just this minor thing The staff was amazingly helpful offering detailed tips for city escapes always with a smile on their face Very cozy lounge area and great decoration The breakfast was very basic but enough to get you started Metro line M5 is right in front of the hotel Great value for money highly recommended,1
 Although we had checked the day before and everything was OK When we arrived Saturday we were told the rooms were double booked and the receptionist was uninterested in our problem The next 9 approx couples that arrived were all told the same The Manager wanted to ship us to a hotel the other side of London Only the fact they had debited my card the day before got them to put us in a sister hotel down the road The room was tiny By the time all this was sorted we missed the first 90mins of our concert I wouldn t be surprised if our original rooms were given to a wedding party at their neighbouring hotel  Not a lot See next comment ,0
 The staff was very rude They were not friendly in the welcome they seemed upset when we joined the breakfast last minutr and they appeared to be more friendly only when leaving the hotel Indeed they were the most rude staff I have ever seen in a 4 stars hotel  The hotel was clean and we had a good deal ,0

"We got a great rate through Hotwire and stayed here for three days while doing genealogy research and site seeing in Washington DC. We could easily walk to the Archives and catch the metro anywhere else. Room was good size, bathrooms very small--just enough for one person at a time. Staff assistance was erratic--one day we got shampoo, the next day none. Linens were very high end and comfortable, room was always clean. We took a previous writers suggestion and parked our car at Union Station for the - days saving $-- each day in parking fees. Weird neon lighting in hallways and lobby area aren't attractive, but room was just fine. It's across the street from the Hyatt Regency---easy to find on a map.

 Staff was almost rude upon our arrival no restaurant that serves dinner gym cannot really be called a gym bed uncomfortable too soft a window in the bathroom facing the sleeping area so if you use the bathroom in the middle of the night you will light up the whole room Location outside the city center with not that attractive surroundings If you ask me this is more like a 3 hotel  Breakfast was pretty good but not included in our room price Best mojito we have ever tasted in the lobby bar Free parking nearby Pet friendly ,0
 The renovation noise The location of the property,1
 The rooftop pool was a disappointment and there was a bad smell coming from the drains into our room which we was informed is common for that part of the city  The staff were very helpful and friendly It was a good location with a metro very close giving good access to the rest of the city There are plenty of nice reasonably priced places to eat nearby ,0
"This is an older, dated hotel, especially the public areas. There are only - small elevators that seem always occupied. There is no concierge level. However, the rooms are spacious with new furnishings, and a great bed. Bathroom was small and worn. Breakfast buffet was good, but not great, front desk staff very friendly, and the shuttle to the airport timely. Not a shining star in the Hilton chain, which has some excellent airport hotels. Not sure if I would stay here again, as the Airport Marriott is so much nicer, newer, and more convenient.",0

 Didn t give us room with accessible bathroom Expensive parking Large room Good view,0
No Negative Very glad to have chosen the Grange Wellington It s a little walk away from Victoria station but it means it enjoys a quieter area and looks out onto a lovely little park The building itself is elegant and stately and the interiors were subdued yet stylish We were given a twin room rather than the double which we were expecting but it wasn t really a problem so we didn t bother asking for a change The staff were polite friendly and welcoming and our room had everything we were looking for We will definitely be staying with Grange hotels again ,1

 I was given a disabled room even though I had booked in advance and when i spoke to reception he told me they allocated me this room as the hotel was very busy I did not expect that response and told him I was very upset about the situation and he finally moved me to a normal room I feel that I was lied to in the first instance that the hotel was fully booked and also having paid what I did I don t expect this level of service Very disappointing experience indeed and it did not help as I was exhibiting in the morning as I did not get proper rest No Positive,0

 lacks spirit and magic something that touches you to remember The concept of reserving sunbeds at the pool area PUROBEACH where you have to pay for the good beds with a forced consumption p package is totally unacceptable the long ques it s an efficient rational what you see is what you get a well ruin machine ,0

"My Agency chose this hotel for a course that I attended. 
The bathtub was stained and patched with caulking all over. housekeeping missed the room one day. Had to request bath soap and toilet paper because staff did not replenish during the day.

 Booked a double bed got given two singles Location speed at putting things right ,1
 The hotel was cramped and claustrophobic There was practically no space in the room to work The bathroom was tiny and we both had difficulty using the shower because we had to step over the toilet bowl to get through the door There was little space shelf to put soap and razors Flannels were not provided which is unusual in a modern hotel these days It was very close to Paddington station where I had to catch an early train This saved me from getting up in the middle of the night,0

 I have stayed at the Cavendish on Jermyn Street numerous times before and never had a problem This time the room was filthy when I arrived plus the hotel tried to overcharge me on vacating the room The hotel tried to charge me for breakfast that I did not have and questioned my integrity when i said I had not had breakfast Per the time stamped on the breakfast chitty I had actually been at work for an hour in Mayfair when the breakfast was being eaten Attitude of the hotel stank especially towards a guest who has stayed numerous times before usually in the most expensive Penthouse suite Having stayed in this hotel for the past 12 years usually in the Penthouse Suite I will not be returning and therefore they have lost a valuable customer  Location,0

 Food in the restaurant was very expensive for what it was breakfast was extortionate parking expensive and one evening the electric went off so our car was stuck in the car park We complained and the hotel only paid one way for us to get to la ramblas so we had to pay 20 euros to get home which we had not budgeted for through no fault of ours No lounge area to relax indoors with comfy seating Our room was supposed to be a no smoking room but the bathroom smelled of smoke slightly when we arrived  Comfy bed and air conditioning heating good Bathroom freebies great and shower hot and powerful ,0

 There was a separate toilet which was a brilliant idea but no wash basin to wash your hands You had to use the bathroom afterwards which defeats the purpose of the separate toilet  Use of the swimming pool The staff were very helpful You could store your luggage to allow you to explore There is extra glazing on the windows so there is no noise from outside ,1

The staff were mostly friendly, and competent. The room was nice, but some odd design decisions. It's all new which is nice, and I also liked the free wifi.
The downstairs bar is a decent enough spot to finish up after a fun night out too -- it has a patio area with a nice enough view of the surrounding city. I had a Hoegaarden down there for $- which seemed reasonable.
Definitely ry some of the Korean BBQ in the area while you're there.",1
 Room is dirty with dust everywhere and furthermore room is small with door not fully opening and catching the corner of the bed can t use microwave facilities to beat food however you can order room service 24 7 I don t get how you can cook me a brand new meal but not heat up my food that I payed for earlier or bought from another establishment not I mpressed The staff are very friendly and helpful and totally cater to customers during there stay,0

There was a lot of noise during sleeping hours, jmost of the nise appeared to be caused by locals talkking, yelling and running back and forth.",0
 Everything was PERFECT for us There was a refuse strike going on in Paris whilst we were there but that s not hotel fault and it didn t even bother us we still had an amazing time  Location superb Concierge all of them were very helpful and friendly particularly Andre ,1
 The beds were so soft and not firm at all so you would sink when you lay on them I am small person and in weight so it s definitely not me The bed was exceedingly small in size and not representative of normal hotel bed sizes The doors on the bedroom do not do much to block out the sounds of the hotel hallways and you can hear each and every guest or staff walk past your room The bathrooms were small and only had showers in them The hotel only gave 1 large towel per room which I thought odd and not standard hotel policy for London No Positive,0
 The bed of the single room is so short that I would not fit in it and I am 190cm not exceptionally tall It should be clearly written about the small bed No Positive,0
 The room was very small and the price was very high  The location was very nice walking distance to everything we wanted to see ,0

No Negative Nice hotel great location,1
 The room was cold and it s like it would warm upNo Positive,0
 Elevators for different floors are on different sides of the lobby weird The rest of my family were staying on the 5th floor and the elevator to their floor was not easily accessible Food was not great and poor value for money  Comfortable bed nice bathroom,1
 Noise from reception if they give you room 1 refuse Bathroom was a joke and the floor flooded into the room and swamped the carpet I could not pull the chair out to work because there was not enough room On check out they incentivise you to not to book through Booking com Location,0

No Negative Excellent location,1
 Unfriendly waitstaff and cost of room was excessive for not very much luxury Room was large but tiny little bathroom and risky tub for showder  Free breakfast was a requirement It was good but the waitstaff was elusive Staff was ok but not friendly or helpful ,0
 I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again No Positive,0
 They put me in the side off the side building I had to go down a weird stair way to another stairway and the room was super small They had other rooms but stuck me in there  near Paddington and your door man is wonderful ,1

 Location is a bit out of the way but as long as you are aware of this beforehand it s ok Cost 15 taxi to central London 30 mins tube to KX Spa facilities looked good not used but no pool  Price cleanliness Hotel was modern and had good facilities Nice breakfast ,1
 Bored and unhelpfull staff parking is two blocks away and quite expensive 18 per night  Well located hotel quite newly equipped ,1
 Room was planned not very comfortable to my opinion a small bedroom and a big lounge room Also it wasn t comfortable to go to a toilet that was also too small room near the room entrance Staff is very nice especially in evening when we came All our needs very fully satisfied Also good price and location for parking,1
 Nothing Yes,1
 how they can rate it as a 4 star hotel no gym no bar a tiny reception and no restaurant and the rate is very high in compare with other real 4 stars hotel  the stuff,0
 FOOD staff nose not clean enough The location,0
 This was a disabled access room a tiny sink that was near the floor the showerhead only came to chest height and nowhere to put your toiletries Nice room apart from this  Nice room but it was a disabled access room ,0
 Closed parking is cool but too small for that big hotel The TV seems fine but impossible to turn off and gets 2 minutes to start After 2 days from 3 lifts worked only one  Clean easy to parking,0
 Room was tiny and double bed was merely two small single beds pushed together Bathroom looked like a fishbowl glass walls which gave little to no privacy The gym consisted of three machines in an over sized closet  Staff were pleasant and very accommodating Breakfast was your typical continental style They offered a complimentary brunch which was nice ,1
 The area around is ok But in one block there is an underground station and the nicer area starts  Well decorated spacious rooms nice city view with skyscrapers ,1
 Didn t advise that more than 1 person in a double room meant an extra 30 euro not advised on booking site  Location was excellent,0
Good location. Host was very responsive. Recommended for short stay.,1

 Unfortunately this is an apartment and there is nothing good to say about this hotel Please don t go if you want a nice hotel especially for GCC citizents Nothing,0
"The hotel is in a convenient location, close to the subway system which we used often without any problems. The Old Town Trolley Tour stops right outside the hotel. The hotel is in a good walking distance to many attractions, i.e. Boston Common, Prudential Centre, Museum of Fine Arts & Newbury St (good people watching!) We walked to and from the hotel at night and felt perfectly safe, also felt safe at night on the subway.
Staff were accommodating, we were booked into a twin room and they arranged a king bed on request. Rooms are dated, but large & clean and that is all we needed as we were only in the room to sleep. Our room faced Huntington Ave (main road) but we did not have any problems with traffic noise. 
For the price we would recommend.",1
 Couldn t fault it Bed was so comfy,1
No Negative The bed was ridiculously comfy,1
 Staff treatment and room size is too small  I like the location ,0

No Negative Excellent Breakfast good room ,1
 Very soft and small beds 140 cm No mini bar so actually you can t store things Floor in our room was very old and not straight and all the room was crooked Staff was very kind and helpful Location is great Free and quick wifi,1
 Huge mess up with the bill The reception charge your credit card with your room rate charges plus a percentage more on top in case you apparently break something or charge stuff to your room then when we checked out they charged the card again with charges for dinner drinks from someone elses room The bill is completely non sensical so my advise is check it before you check out  Location excellent for west end shopping Lovely staff Rooms basic comfortable and clean ,1
 Not being able to use the phone in my room Proximity to the Park accessible via DLR,1
 Not clean The bathroom shower had dried fecal matter in the bottom The bed sheets had long curly hairs on the them which made is seem like they hadn t been changed We were moved to another room and there was dried poop on the toilet seat we arrived very late and didn t discover until after unpacking and at this point it was 2 a m Although a sanitary paper had been placed over the toilet there was still dried poop on the seat Photos were taken of it all and provided to staff There were no extra amenities offered or discounts for the disgusting encounters  Location night staff and room were really great ,0
 this is not a 4 star hotel period  staff was very very nice ,0
 The room was noisy due to a highway nearby  The stuff effective and friendly the breakfast is good The location is VERY convenient ,1
 We felt the breakfast was not worth the high price Room was very comfy and modern One of the nicest bathrooms of any hotel i ve seen Staff were very helpful and courteous The location in relation to the o2 was perfect ,1
No Negative Location is perfect,1
 Extremely expensive for what was offered Room had a theme which was nice but was quite old and looked a tad shabby 470 per night and breakfast NOT included but they don t tell you this till you leave At which point they charge you another 75 per night for city tax and breakfast No tea or coffee making facilities in room Room service is lazy as they could not be bothered to replace our dirty wine glasses with clean ones nor to replace the mini complimentary water bottles that we used on first evening there Breakfast was quite nice but not worth the money they charged Even an expensive restaurant would of been cheaper An extremely disappointing experience  The location was great ,0
 The room was very small The bathroom was very small also old chip in Bath needed a real spruce up Tiny draws in bedside cupboards wardrobe didn t really exist small cupboard with no doors no real room to hang clothes up the lifts were small although there were two we had to wait for quite a while ane ended going up and down a lot  It s location ,0

 The staff were pretty miserable  Nice food Nice d cor Clean and pretty ,0
No Negative Great central location good breakfast and staff very helpful,1
 They put a family with young children next to a group of men who were letting every one in their room from 3am in the morning until 5 30am with the door being knocked on and banging their door shut The strong smell of alcohol Please check which visitors are being put next to each other Explained this to staff they did say if I would have phoned down to the reception they would have sorted things out  Good breakfast nice views ,0
 Breakfast is not worth the charge  Good size bedroom and bathroom for central london,0
"I stayed at the Hudson over the New Year with my kids. I am a single Dad, traelling from England and wanted somewhere my kids could relax to. We booked for - nights and loved it. Ok, rooms are not that big but we knew that before we went. But what a funky hotel. It made a change to stay in something different and I have stayed in it's sister hotel in NYC, The Paramount (not happy with that one). The service was excellent. We had trouble with the air-con leaking in our room the second day. We mentioned it and got swapped straight away. They refunded us one night and knocked a futher $-- off a night for the other - nights. Loved the garden and the big breakfast room. Really enjoyed it and would definitely stay there again.",1
 Breakfast wasn t included in the price Location was great as were the facilities and you get a free bottle of beer and fresh milk in the room fridge I would visit again ,1
 The breakfast was a disaster Had to wait for someone to take us to a table for 4 5mins and then we had enough and just walked to a table We have our table number to a waitress Had to wait a further 10 mins for 2 poached eggs and 1 fried egg People waiting for ages for a table no organisation no communication between staff Really comfy bed and great location,0
 This is the worst experience for me in a hotel never stay again at this hotel  Very bad services check in took very long time house keeping didn t clean the room well I spent for 5 days in the hotel 5,0
 N A Good hotel great breakfast,1
"I was really excited to stay at The Peabody on a recent trip. Checking in at the lobby, my expectations were set even higher. Unfortunately, upon entering the room all my previous hopes were dashed. The bathroom could be one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen (this is after spending extensive time travelling around Europe, a continent known for small bathrooms). The room looked as if it hadn't been updated since The Peabody opened. The quality of the room in no way met the finish of a four star hotel. My stay was only a night, but on return trips to Memphis I plan to stay in a hotel where the rooms are a bit more updated.",0
 Room was not so clean carpet was dirty bathroom could do better Price high for the given facilities but London is expensive anyway  The location was excellent near Bank and Monument stations ,0
 Our double bed had a gap  Pleasure to stay there smallish but really comfortable room under the roof with a stunning view over the inner city of Vienna Really friendly forthcoming and we ll trained staff who fulfilled all our wishes ,1
 Expected a lot more for the price and it being a 4 hotel Not good value for money  It was quiet ,0
No Negative Privacy excellent just what I wanted and not any crowd s of other guests will use again definitely ,1
 to much far from city center and metro lines no restaurant and no bar at night no room service my room as some broken items No Positive,0
 Walls between rooms were thin was woken on the second night at 2am by people talking in their room next door One bedside lamp fitting in the room didn t work Shower was weak pressure and small I m 6 foot and couldn t fit underneath the shower head which is fixed in place  Room was good size staff were very friendly good location ,1
"This was my first visit to NYC with friends. The hotel was chosen by a friend. The rate was great for the location and was a beautiful hotel. I had a king room which was more spacious than expected. The bathroom was larger than expected as well. There was a large closet with safe, ironing board and iron, and umbrella. The room also included a refrigerator and microwave. The honor bar prices were very reasonable and included two complimentary waters. The bed was very comfortable. Traffic noise was acceptable.
The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. We were really pleased with the concierge for getting us into a restaurant a few hours before dinner. 
I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend The Kimberly Hotel.",1
 They lie to me In the booking de the picture of the Deluxe double room shows the room is large so I booked the Deluxe double room however when I arrived there they gived us a room much smaller Then I asked them why they just answered that the picture is wrong it is actually the club double room they also said that there have been many customers argued that and they refused to change our room They know the picture is wrong and lie people to book the much smaller Deluxe double room  the room is clean and the location is also near the underground station ,0
 Noise old photo s are not like real Location,0
 Everything very Bad Everything Bad,0
 Although not on the main road traffic can be heard all night which is a problem if you re a light sleeper No slippers in the room We asked for slippers and one bathrobe as we wanted to go swimming with kids and waited Called again to follow up and staff advised it was on the way only to receive a call afterwards saying they do not have any available as they await the delivery  Most staff were friendly,1
 The rooms are too small too hot and the bathroom was cramped and didn t seem too clean  I love the location of this hotel ,0
"The McCormick Hyatt is convenient for a convention but has some staffing issues.
the doormen do not try to hard to flag down taxis for the guests. In fact, they seem to spend too much time talking amongst themselves while the line for taxis grows ever longer.
The staff that make the coffee in the little store between the lobby and the Shor restaurant do a very poor job, are slow and not customer friendly.
The rooms are fine, and the cleanliness is good",0
 the room was so small it was ridiculousNo Positive,0
 Slight frustration that there were no towels available on our arrival and we were not able to shower before going out in the evening after travelling all day staff did apologise but should not happen really  The location is very good ,1
 Shower was a bit strange with the frosted glass panel separating it from the main bedroom part Pillows were too soft for my liking i wasnt enough but 2 were too much Pool was bit on the small side but still adequate Wasnt always a parking space available and it was cheaper to stay in the ExCel covered car park  plenty of space in the room for cases bags etc Beds very comfy Awesome views from the higher floors Staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the 24hour snack bar in the lobby Bar was a great place to sit and chill of an evening and Id recommend the pizzas as they were delicious Very close to the ExCel centre and the DLR which was perfect for us ,1
No Negative Fantastic service nothing was too much trouble,1
 We were taken to our room on check in to find it was still occupied by the previous guests A very basic error unworthy of the Savoy The hotel had lost some of its character and charm and seemed focussed on maximising their share of my wallet rather than focussing on giving us a memorable experience The prices in the American bar were ludicrous and the my 7 year old grandson could have played better than the resident pianist The Super King Luxury room wasn t really No more than adequate and very expensive  The hotel was clean and immaculate The Savoy Grill was excellent Breakfast was good although the room needed a maitre d ,0
 Free parking for guests Very new modern hotel,1
 Everything Its totally bad hotel,0

 Cleaning staff knocking on door at 9a m 10a m wanting towels to be cleaned on check out day Fortunately one was aware that the French star system is unique to France  Very central for touring,0
 Being too close to the noise of the lift Bed was really comfy tea and coffee was really welcoming if there was one negative it was being too close to the lift as we could hear it going up and down and doors opening and shutting but would stay here again,1
 Don t go out after dark this is a poor area to stay in there are people sleeping rough right outside the hotel not just one but lots Also lady s of the night are everywhere in the area if you want that great I m streetwise but I felt intimidated  Stayed here for business trip for one night hotel itself is good it is the location that lets it down,0
 Size of the bed and room Reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served 3 or 4 people while I was trying to pay  Bed and room was very small seemed like a large single sized bed Bar was nice and cozy and open all the time Close to Queensway tube station which was handy Quiet area,0
 Noisy Carpet is dirty Location,0
 Bathroom was in need of refurbishment bit smelly too The room was at the top of the building there is no lift and the steps are very very narrow  Fab location close to all atractions ,0
 A small swimming pool the pool area lacks sun light not good for sunbathing because it s not a rooft top pool and is hidden by neighboring buildings that block the sun also there was no extras like a spa or sauna I would expect that for the price and stars Also no free slippers again higher star hotels provide this also it s hard to completely relax because the sound of the doors slamming in neigbouring rooms comes through into my room and the cleaners are outside the rooms from very early making it hard to have complete silence and relaxation  The bed was comfortable the shower was big and fancy The air conditioning worked well and made my stay comfortable ,0
 I booked online but the hotel didn t have my reservation so I had to wait for a long time  The bed was so comfortable The window blinds were amazing,0

 Couldn t have breakfast because I didn t book initialy  Good Chinese restaurant allied to hotel,1
 the double bed could be bigger location breakfast very good hotel,1
 The landscaping needs to be finished for the full effect Using the hotel s other entrance when ready will make a big difference when it s raining  Very good location and a breakfast worth getting up a little bit earlier to savour ,1
 The view from the room but hey who sits and looks out of a room window  Excellent location and great value for money for the standard of room Right in the center of Soho everything you needed for whatever type of break you are looking for Staff really friendly and helpful nothing was a problem Nice clean rooms would definitely stay again,1

 Well I first booked a single room That room was too small had no desk and it was very noisy street noise were beyond imagination So I asked the hotel staff to locate me to another room so the did after the manager approval to a double room Which I think was a positive gesture of them  The double room are generally ok except the one in the basement as it is very close to the kitchen Their breakfast is very good perfectly cooked eggs fresh veggies and other stuff The staff are really friendly and the hotel location is perfect very close to goodge station Oxford st and the London school ,0
"I just wanted to tell you that I had an awesome experience at your Tropicana pool bar. It was a fairly busy night and the bartender Andrew while making tons of drinks kept taking time to chat with me, welcome me and make me feel at home while on business. I know bartending can be stressful with so many people but he handled it great and kept the drinks flowing. Thanks.",1
 Only got complimentry coffee and tea on your 1st night although there is a kettle in the room Toilet a bit dated Location was perfect,0

 We were locked out of our room fridge because there was a problem with my card I went downstairs and it went through ok it would have been nice to have been notifed there was a problem instead of just locking us out  Rooms were lovely and very clean Shower was great too The hotel decor was very cool loved the artwork ,0

 The mattress is too soft can t sleep very well  Staffs are very nice Very central location ,1
 Small room pool 6ft and a little on small side Pool nice and worm,0
 No complementary water very inconvenient cleanliness very superficial  Location cordial staff,1
 However the cleanliness was very bad The plasma was very dusty The bath was not cleaned properly and the lamps were all dusty The location was good and staff was helpful,0
 The room was very small and on the first floor in spite of our request for a room on the higher floors Accordingly we were crowded and there was virtually no view other than the street Excellent staff very courteous and ready to help often anticipating what we wanted to inquire about Guillermo in particular is a fountain of information both positive and negative info which we found to be accurate and added value to our time and resources ,1
 Was not happy with the size of room bathroom hallways elevators n lobby Clean room n bed,0

 Issues with our room but management understand and did their best after knowledge of it to resolve the matter Thank you to the manager for that Will come back next year most likely to see our room is fixed  Like the staff recommendation for dinner and overall all staffs were good Good breakfast french style with buffet Good location near Champs lys e and near subway ,1
 There was a chilly wind which seemed to enter the lobby to which the bar and restaurant were open We went to our room to gather pullovers There was a knack to making the hairdryer work that we never mastered I overheard another guest reporting a similar issue  Comfortable reasonably priced modern London hotel with good transport links in a niche location It was not like an impersonal airport or central London hotel The staff we met were enthusiastic to help and serve We dined in the restaurant and were not disappointed ,1
 The Hotel is over rated in term of facilities and ambiance inside the premises  Location,0
 Service not great had to ring down twice for complimentary teas and coffees to be brought up and second morning service at breakfast poor also beds uncomfortable and asked for foam pillows as feather pillows didn t give any support and they did not have any although literature said they did for the money this is all about location  Right next to South Kensington tube station decor plush in rooms and whole of hotel within walking distance of Harrods,0
 Cocktails on the pricey side  Nice bed lots of room,1
 Why would you have kitchens next door to the dining room it spoiled the weekend you could not enjoy the breakfast as it was so hot in that area Friendly staff,0

 The TV did not have all the channels working something which could not be fixed in 24 hours  Excellent location quiet but very central and in walking distance to many great spots The room was comfortable the bed very large and professional service was to a high level of attention ,1
 Room a little small but adequate Cool spacious hotel with amazing shower,1
 Room could have been attend to before 6pm both days Staff In particular Restaurant Management were extremely poor unhelpful gave staff a bollocking in front of the customers and she didn t react well to feedback ,0
 I stayed 2 separate nights each time was charged 50 euros on my Visa Debit card I was told that this was only a deposit in case of incidental expenses I have not been reimbursed the 100 00 euros owed to me and frankly find this very irritating I will now have to report it to my bank for them to pursue I did speak to reception and all they kept on saying was that it was a hold however my account clearly shows 2 transactions of 50 euros taken from my account I really despise surprise costs at billing Really poor form  The location is perfect for Eurostar The Baggage manager is excellent ,0
 Nothing particular  Location location and great value for the price Ok the hotel is not new but has everything you need for a stay in London If you want spectacular hotel than you ll have to pay for it not expect to have a Plaza stay for Britannia price ,1
 Huge noise from street tram noise rooms are not noise insulatedNo Positive,1
 we had the red room Bit small A bit more space to put away the suitcase etc  Cosy bedroom slept like a queen Breakfast was ok ,1
 Rooms are in a poor state with flaky walls and poor furniture Even the main hallways are in a poor state and need a lot of renovation Room is not a 4 star standard at all Adjoining the palais des congres where I had a congress So very convenient for business purposes Not far away from the center and easily accessible ,0
No Negative Great and friendly staff amazing breakfasts,1
 Rooms Rooms are poky extremely small for a husband wife and child,0
 Where to start Rooms are SMALL As in SMALL Breakfast is the worst I have ever had croissants bread are it with no choice Day 1 we had to come back as not enough seats Day 2 we had to ask for more cups as they were all gone The room was also ridiculously warm at night probably the only place we have had to use aircon in April in the UK  The location is superb the rooms are super clean ,0
 N A The staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble ,1
 housekeeping didn t do much only had partial view of Eiffel tower from room and room was spendy but small with no amenities in hotel other then pretty tiny exercise room Location is great and Eiffel tower is beautiful from window ,0
 Nothing Everything from the staff hotel and friendly atmosphere,1
 Air conditioner was inadequate room was musty and stuffy Awful really The location,0
 As there are some VIPs coming the staff is impolite to other guests You can set prohibit areas but beyond that areas you can t ask the guest where you are going I suggest the hotel close the whole hotel and reject all other bookings when they need to serve the VIPs  Spacious room,0
 The service at lunchtime was a little slow and we had to wait a while for our food Once it came though it was great  We absolutely loved the hotel it was beautiful and in a great location The Skyy Bar is fantastic for an easy night out as well We would love to come back and celebrate New Year s Eve here one year Thank you so much Westcord Fashion Hotel ,1
 3rd time I am at this hotel and they are again understaffed in the reception 15 minuttes waiting time to check in is not OK Don t mention the presense of Mini bar when the mini bar is empty because this hotel is a crew hotel  Convenient location close to my scheduled meetings,0
 Didn t like the pool people were saving seats and they weren t even there The lady staff member behind the bar at the pool was rude Breakfast staff weren t very friendly I asked to be shown how to use the toaster and the girl was rude Location good but not that close to shops  The bed was comfy We liked the fruit platter and water on arrival and that when ever we left our room was made up ,1

No Negative The facilities were wonderful and the staff extremely friendly The breakfast option was also first rate ,1
 Really uncomfortable bed was really firm and gave me backache The duvet and duvet cover were not great either didn t feel great and made a surprising amount of sound with small movements Forgot to put the dnd sign on the door but got a double knock on the door at 9am I consider that far too early on a saturday morning  Good location and facilities Nice touch with the apple imac computers that doubles as a TV ,0
 room not clean breakfest good,1
 airconditioning really poor in my room receptionist dint bother to fix breakfast was ok but not much variety,0
 Disgusting dirty poor quality fittings damaged sanity units and shower smells Mound in rooms including window bugs seriously overpriced 1 not 4 Customer service awful no air conditioning dirty bathrooms carpets skirting nothing positive to say oh and food don t go there I spend a lot of time in hotels and this has to be the worst  Nothing Awful from entering hotel to depart Disappointed,0
 Poor Wi Fi Superb location well connected to centrum excellent food big portions welcoming staff ,1
 Air conditioner did not work I try to solve the problem several times even changed room but anyway the temperature was around 25 me and my father slept badly  The location was goed Near to Gare du Montparnasse so I had how to go directly to where I wanted ,0
No Negative The staff was excellent and very helpful and provided us with lots of information on restaurants and sites ,1
 We have stayed at the Tryp Hotel in Berlin and thought it looked very similar in the images they show While this is true and the hotel lobby and lower levels are very funky clean and new This is not at all true for the remainder of the hotel The rooms are very old and very dirty and there is a stale smell in the air  Our stay was ok in the end but only because the staff were kind enough to offer us one of the prototype rooms for the hotel upgrade starting in September The breakfast was very nice and the staff were very helpful and happy to work to resolve any problems ,0
 The view from bedroom windows were brick walls so no natural light in room This is only reason why score not a 10 Next time will reserve room with garden or river view Staff were so friendly helpful Every area of the hotel was comfortable spotlessly clean Hotel was within walking distance of Westminster Trafalgar Square Embankment tube station was just around the corner so location was ideal ,1
 One small point Coffe and tea making in the rooms Could have used proper spoons instead of plastic Didn t notice a safe But didn t need it  Obviously the location was excellent staff helpful clean well furnished rooms Plus a small gym ,1
 Staff and breakfast Room was ok,0
 I had to change the room I received initially because it virtually had almost no wardrobe Wifi is very weak Friendly staff,1
 Bed was the worst bed ever Far to soft Shame as it made the stay uncomfortable Lovely hotel in a good location for westend and shops,0
 Everything was great Great location for what we needed easy transfer to the airport included,1
 The internet was inaccessible in our room but the receptionist said that she would get this sorted out and our room had an opaque window that didn t open so it felt claustrophobic  The receptionist was pleasant and efficient ,0
 Only location Service is bad except for on guy in the night shift Mattress is overused shower flow is very weak and heater is not working,0
 More milk with the tea coffee in the room Everything ,1
No Negative Huge room size stylish and comfortable decor super comfortable bed bright and airy rooms perfect ,1
"We stayed in the Sofitel in mid October ---- for - nights and thought it was wonderful. The location was brilliant, just - minutes from Time Square and all the hussle and bustle of the Big Apple. But....even though it was so close to everything it was incredibly, a small haven of tranquility. We booked a suite (which was huge by NYC standards) so we were on a high floor. It was utterly silent up there and I slept brilliantly on the beautifully comfortable bed. The bathroon was lovely with a huge walk in shower but the 'large' bath we were promised when we booked failed to materialise!! The lifts were very speedy and we never had to wait for them unlike in other hotels (Parker Meridien). Free internet in the lobby topped it off. We would definately stay here again.",1
 hair in the pool vomit on the floor big groups in the hotel bad price value gym was dirty nothing,0
 First room was too small We moved to two beds room on our last day and it was great,1

 Very small room deluxe double even by London standards Room was close to the lifts and so from around 6am we were kept awake by the sound of the lift each time it reaches our floor The arrival gong noise should be disabled No Positive,1
 better lighting in the room would be preferred and no hot water kettle in the room Fridge wasnt too effective However staff were good enough to always provide us with hot drinking water when required  good location Close to a grocery shop and tram service to the city,1
 We were a little disappointed with the room as it was quite small We had booked a deluxe double and cannot see that we got what we ordered We are not sure of the difference and didn t query this as the room was only being used as a base for 1 night but if we had booked a longer stay we would have been very disappointed  Staff were very helpful Location was good and facilities good also ,1
No Negative Lovely large room 2 toilets was good ,1
 The windows were very very bad isolated from wind and coldness I had the maximum tempriture on the heater but it doesn t help because the wind was intering from everywhere if the windows Solution change the windows with a three glass window with Argon gas inside slicone could be a cheap alternate You may put silcone around the windows No Positive,0

 Service on the hotel bar was very slow 2 times of 5 i did not get my drink  Very nice and welcome hotel great staff ,1

 Didn t really use facilities  We were celebrating a 30th birthday and the staff went out their way to help us celebrate with free extras It was great They also remembered the plans we had to wish us to enjoy them Hotel location was the key thing that was amazing ,1
 Unfortunately therw was only one lift working which made it difficult to get to the 6th floor  Excellent staff and service Lovely and clean room with very comfortable bed Good location ,1

"Yes, it's a W Hotel and it's undoubtedly one of the hippest hotels in Chicago and yes, it offers a stunning view of lake Michigan and yes, the rooms are decorated in such a way that you feel like you live in a lounge bar. If these are the things you're looking for then go for it. 
BUT if you''re like me, someone who also needs top quality attentive services then you'll be supremely disappointed. Perhaps me and my wife need to be reminded that the word """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""HIP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is mutually exclusive with the word """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SERVICE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".",0
 I don t recommend this hotel for allergic people The carpets are highly allergic We stayed only one night but we suffered from allergic symptoms For this reason I would not stay here again  This was my second stay in Brunelleschi Hotel Location is very good Breakfast is sufficient The details in the room are nice especially bathroom is very well equipped ,1
 AC unit and TV Location and breakfast,0
 We were told the Metro was closer it was definitely more than 250 yrds The bed was uncomfortable as I woke with a sore back each morning which lasted the duration of the following day Staff were as friendly as could be but their English wasn t great and directions to places were hard to understand  Location was good very near the Arc de Triomhe There is a beautiful Patisserie very close to the hotel up beside the chapel which we had breakfast in each morning eat here Metro was about an 8 10 minute quick walk and had access to many places ,0

"Like many others, I booked this hotel on priceline. We got one of the newly renovated rooms, which was really nice, but the building next to us and our own patio were still under construction. The big bummer though was the extra charges for everything, namely parking. There is a sign outside saying valet is $---day, so we self parked. Little did we know that self parking is also $---day even though the hotel is not in the downtown area so I'm not sure why they have to charge so much. We found a bill under our door at the end of our stay and at the front desk they told me I had agreed to it in some fine print when I signed the check in slip. The setting, however, is on a nice spot on Mission Bay.",0
 Away from city centre Poor light in room Hotel outside city centre in western part of city But tram station across the road line 12 Staff helpful Room good size clean and clean very nice bathroom with shower no bath tub Room too dark No fridge but small vending machine Near bye supermarket Lidel There is no place to have breakfast near the hotel in case you do not wAnt to pay17 50 euros per person per day for open buffet breakfast Very efficient Tram system in Amsterdam,0

 The hotel was difficult to find with our Navigation system but once there it was great The overnight parking was 25 Euros a night which was a bit expensive since we had paid at most 20 in other places and even as low as 5  Loved the breakfast it included Mimosas It was the typical Italian breakfast The hotel was beautiful and very modern The bed was the most comfortable of our 12 days trip The bathroom was large and the shower amazing The reception provided great service with good advice on where to eat and how to get around not the tram ,1
 Hard beds small rooms Great shower ,0
 Cleaning staff entered room without knocking Very busy with functions Not enough staff but they did their best On checkout two receptionists more intent on their private conversation whilst queue got longer Given wrong times for breakfast  Breakfast choice good ,0
 Room small and claustrophobic and in the basement No Positive,0
 The bathroom The sliding door was hard to open only by force There was a bick crack in the sink room 712 The drain off from the bath tub was to slow almost blocked  To have 3 Underground lines at your door step is a big plus Saves you time and money Included breakfast was super My wish to get another room was fulfilled instantly without discussion initial room 207 was leading to the quiet side of the hotel but on to a rooftop of a utility area which was repellent ,0
 Cleaning and the pillow not good Location,1
 The wi fi was extremely slow Great location very close to museums and U,1
 Everything except the staff at hotel which was a shame Check in lady was very abrupt barman in the evening was much the same Such a shame for a nice hotel  Location was excellent for us as we were going to The Royal Albert hall so just a short walk for us ladies in the evening Lovely area and did not have the madness of central London,1
 Nothing Location and staff,1
 Room was quite small even for a single as is the fitness room  High standard hotel right next to tube station short walk to shops and various attractions Good breakfast and great staff ,1
 Need to sack the entire cleaning crew Upon arrival we had to move rooms because the first one was infested with aunts Second morning They threw the pillows on the bed so they were all over and it was all wrinkly Didn t leave us with any hand towels Maybe they were on strike or something and it was a way of complaining Either way not our problem so they get a negative mark on their cleaning standards  Receptionist team was outstanding and made us feel like at home Very nice people professional and resolutive ,0

"Well, this was a pretty average hotel stay. 
Pro: full breakfast has a lot of options
Con: same thing everyday
Pro: happy hour with free drinks
Con: same lame tortilla chips and salsa everyday for snacks
Pro: underground parking
Con: overpriced and very tight for a Tahoe. Took me -- to get vehicle out of a spot.
Pro: extra sinks in rooms for brushing teeth
Con: decor, furnishings and wood showing age
Pro: walking to metro is fun
Con: only the first time. After two times, the four block walk isn't fun any more. And DC cabs add extra per person.
Very Con: BS $-- charge for departing a day early. Luckily our next place is $-- less than This hotel, so it evened out
Staff friendly enough, but I want better for my $--- next time.",0
 Nothing Excellent room Very gd staff who assisted following underground issues closures Quality and big thanks,1
No Negative Quiet comfortable room with great size bed and comfy firm mattress The hotel has a great central location by Covent Garden and is easy to get around from by bus tube and taxi Plenty of great places to eat nearby ,1
 There weren t even any towels in the room I booked 5 rooms supposed to be twin but 4 were twin and one with a double bed so two grown men not related or gay had to share a bed The Strand is the worst hell hole we have ever stayed in and the cost was daylight robbery They should be ashamed  Nothing,0
 Price was a bit high for someone traveling from South Africa  Excellent location with a supermarket just across the road friendly efficient staff and nice breakfast ,1
No Negative Pool view from the pool the room was not too small and nicely furnished ,1
 We had a basement room so there wasn t a window to the outside just one to a corridor Prices were high as it was New Year s Eve but overly priced Small room with ensuite with a glass door to the tiny bathroom meant there was no privacy  Closely located to Paddington Efficient check in and could leave bags with reception whilst we went exploring the following day ,0

 The pressure of the water was poor for bath No Positive,1
 Noise road very small room with smell of fuel and dump in room left takes you to the reception only you have to carry your luggage to your room using the stairs  location only ,0
 WiFi was extremely bad kept disconnecting and completely unreliable Ruined the experience throughout my entire stay Room service menu as well as my one time lunch in the restaurant the menu is small and food wasn t as good as expected and definitely wasn t worth the price paid Location room cleanliness as well as comfort bedding pillows sheets was above expectations and very satisfying,1
 Would be nice if the roof terrace opened later on a night as it closes at 7 30pm  Staff were really helpful facilities were great lovely pool cocktail bar on the terrace Would highly recommend ,1
 The WiFi is the only thing I didn t like here You have essentially zero privacy on this network they can monitor and store all your internet activity according to their terms and conditions and due to an unencrypted connection  The staff was very friendly and the room facilities were excellent ,1
 Room cleanliness was appalling The bathroom didn t even have all round curtains for privacy bathroom activities could be seen by adjacent flats I travel frequently this was a terrible hotel for the price Value for money Absolutely not  What did I like I can t think of anything ,0
 No hot water in the morning Staff great ,0
 Staff unwelcoming Very uncomfortable bed and very noisy from the cleaners and other guests Rooftop bar well overpriced seats uncomfortable long waiting times even though it wasn t busy Cocktails were rubbish and served in a plastic cup  Location was good Hotel was clean ,0
 Requested a quiet room but we had one on the corner of the building with a cross roads outside and a mini roundabout so traffic noise was bad The fire alarm went off twice and when we used the fire escape at the back of the hotel there was no staff to inform us what was happening We had to walk round to the front of the hotel to find out that it was someone smoking in a room The same thing happened the next morning No Positive,0

"This hotel is like finding an oasis in a neighborhood that has seen better days. The property is clean and all freshly refurnished. Everything looks freshly painted or replaced. Front desk clerk was efficient. The room had a wet bar in addition to the bathroom sink. The king bed was comfortable. Unfortunately our evening sleep was interrupted several times by loud cars and people yelling at the hotel property across the street. The free breakfast was very sparse and basic. 
The property was a good value for an evening on the road. The hotel itself was okay but would look for other options next time and not stay in this neighborhood again.",1
No Negative Cheap old hotel needs total modernisation ,0
 The entrance door of the room would not close by itself and you had to close it by force and make sure it s locked which is not good for security The tab at the bathroom was loose and was not working properly and though I did mention it to the reception nothing was done about it The breakfast was OK and ordinary compare to the price they charge  The room size was good hotel is close to Regent street Oxford street Carnaby st Which is quite convenient for shopping ,0
 Everything was just perfect  The staff was great and helpful The breakfast was excellent the location of the hotel is very central Just 5 minutes walk to the cathedral and 2minutes away from the metro and boat station Highly recommended ,1

 Bed was v small double room v small right next to lift shaft Loud music next door at 4am Outside Knightsbridge is full of the rich boy racers hitting the streets in b loud cars all night Seriously don t go to this hotel if you want any sleep whatsoever My wife had a discussion with the manager in he morning and she never complains about anything She was offered an upgrade next time I really don t think it would make any difference to quality of he stay I stay in a lot of hotels in London over a long period of time I think this has to the worst experience in terms of sleep quality No Positive,0
 There were no biscuits with the tea and coffee making facility  We stayed here as we were going to an evening concert at Wembley It didn t take long to get back and the hotel was quiet and very comfortable after a day in London Breakfast was good ,1
 Shower strangly positioned making complete bathroom wet  Beautiful clean rooms with inspiring art on the walls Staff is very friendly especially at the bar great cocktails small but clean sauna and swimming pool Good breakfast ,1
 could be a bit more generous with the teabags and a lounge would be nice to talk to other travellers v comfortable room and good breakfast lovely views from canal side setting good situation beween main museums and canal system but quiet right next to a tram stop,1
 Reception staff are very rude very unhelpful Stayed in Barcelona many times now and never ever encountered staff like the staff here For this reason I will not be back to the hotel which is a shame as its a gorgeous hotel but definitely ruined out stay as they were all so rude  Beautiful hotel large modern rooms cleaning staff very pleasant Lovely roof top pool gym pool and out door area kept very clean by staff ,0
 Nothing worth mentioning  The hotel being situated on a no through road which makes the area scooter free and very quiet at night unlike in the city Also great for Cruise ship and Ferry watching but close to the town ,1
 The surrounding neighbourhood is not so safe not a place you want to be out at night For this reason when I m in Paris I only stay there the one night before I take the Eurostar  The location is excellent for access to the Gare du Nord and the Eurostar I ve stayed in this hotel twice already for the ease of catching the early morning Eurostar It s just across the street The rooms have kettles so leaving too early for breakfast won t deprive one of coffee The price of the room compared to the other equally convenient hotels is a bargain ,1
No Negative Great place ,1
"This is a somewhat flashy old world luxury hotel beautifully situated at --st and -th. The continental BF was poor, the rooms slightly worn and old, the TV's almost useless, the food and bev quite nice, yet the people and the ambiance are classic old world charming !! Lovely but not worth the price.",0
 I didn t like the location No do not disturb sign to put on the door No mini bar price list The bathroom was very cold Could not put the shower on hot enough also No hair conditioner The restaurant was not open The room did not seem as big as it should have been think the bathroom may have been included in dimensions  The hotel was new and clean Spa area looked nice Dinning and bar area great The bedding was very good Liked the lighting and fittings of the hotel The staff were very nice and helpful ,1
 The hotel needs a refurbishment and a fresh layer of paint The rooms were not very clean and the value for money is non existent  The location is great ,0
 I was in room 408 on the top floor it was right underneath the aircon units for the building They vibrated my room all night like having a washing machine on full spin above your head not good at all Apart from that the hotel was fine I was just unlucky to have that room  Very clean nice breakfast good location and staff ,0
 Same menu everyday for breakfast A variety would have been goodNo Positive,1
 The coffee facilities had no creamer until requested The room had not been properly hoovered before our arrival Rooms were fairly small  The location was perfect ,0
 I think the bedrooms are dated in comparison to the bathroom The room needs better lighting it s quite dark We stayed in 462 Also the pool wasn t open this was not stated on your website so that was a little disappointing  I loved that our room was ready when we arrived at about 11am Staff were so friendly and helpful ,1
The hotel is so conveniently located to the magnificent shoppings along Michigan Ave. Interior decor of the hotel is so luxurious and elegant. Service is excellent. I will defintely stay in Rafaello whenever I have to be in Chicago.,1
 Perfect location very nice stuff great value of moneyNo Positive,1
No Negative Great views of 2 of London Landmarks Comfortable bed and spacious suite Friendly and helpful staff Definitely will stay again ,1
 The rumbling every time the metro passes when i was assigned a room on level 2 Room is too clinical Some warm colours would have made it cosier  Good water pressure for the shower Kitchenette a bonus Rooms are spacious even though very basic and spartan ,1
 The bedroom was basic No air con apart from an electric plug in fan inside the wardrobe No mini bar or fridge Walls are are of poor quality We woke up on numerous occasion from hearing people walking past talking or the closing of doors This hotel needs better sound proofing Unpleasant musty smell in the corridors A makeover would not go a miss  The reception area staff and location are the only things going for this hotel ,0
 The card key wasn t working and we have to change it everyday The receptions are so arrogant We arrived early around 7 00 am but they kept on telling us to wait for an hour as the housekeeper was still cleaning the room That 1 hour lasted until 1 00 pmNo Positive,0

"I traveled to New York with my wife for a filming project, and we needed somewhere fairly central. When we were looking around for a hotel beforehand, we were surprised to see how much prices were increased for early September - most hotels we found had literally tripled their prices, presumably to cash-in on the increased traffic to the city for Sept. -- memorials. The Tudor hotel was one of the few that remained at normal pricing and value. The room was clean, modern with full facilities, and the staff friendly and attentive. We liked.
The only problem, albeit a small one, was that the doors to the rooms are pretty heavy and secure and cannot be closed quietly (we tried - not possible). Early-to-bed-light-sleepers might wish to take earplugs. 
We will certainly be booking at the Tudor hotel again.",1
 Room wasn t stocked with soaps or water on the second day needed to ask for them Second person working nights didn t seem to know the area very well Also I don t remember having a phone in the room to make calls to the front desk or even for emergencies  Staff were friendly and the morning breakfast food coffee and juices were all good ,0
 The staff from reception was really poor arrogant and did not care much about us they were unpolide rud and did not make any effort to resolve our problem or help us with the information Except of the waitress of the restaurant Wich was very kind The hotel is fine beautiful and nice,0
 This hotel while nice enough have chosen to over charge me by 356 00 which they have admitted is their error and yet are unable to resolve it Never staying here again and will most likely not use Booking com again eitherNo Positive,0
 Horrible Hotel The rooms are just above a major train line which operates every few minutes even during the night I couldn t sleep at all Breakfast was just embarrassing there were just some bread and sausages with no pastry fruits or yogurt Staff was not helpful or nice at all they didn t let me replace a room even though there were empty rooms  close to train station not such a good thing ,0

No Negative staff location room size,1
 The door between the bedroom and hallway slammed when it swung closed We had to prop it open to avoid disturbing other guests  Lovely big room very quiet Nice to have a separate dressing room ,1
 The bar was closed at 11 and upon arrival after driving 4 hours when we just asked for a drink to take to the room we were very surprised that the staff almost shouted at us that the bar was closed and they were even eyeballing us very rude very unprofessional and absolutely not necessary Also the parking lot is convenient but it will cost you 40 to 60 euro for 1 night  location and cleanliness Right in the middle of the centre and lots of pubs and eating places but could take advantage because of late arrival and business the next day ,0
 The beds weren t great and neither was the service at the restaurant The staff was extremely nice and helpful the location was great ,1
No Negative The staff were generous and gave me and my partner a free bottle of wine to celebrate his birthday Was such a lovely thought and made us enjoy our weekend that bit more Facilities were great and so was breakfast in the morning ,1
 1 In spite of previous ratings the hotel is located rather far away from all sites 2 Taking a shower is risky water is flooding the room 3 The blankets are made of cheap stuff very uncomfortable 4 Sheets towels etc have not been changed unless specifically requested  The street market outside is nice and lively Helpful staff Espresso machine in the room ,0

 There is no help with baggage they told us to hep ourselves we had a lot of bags and some help would ve been nice The bathroom wall is glass so whoever is staying with you in the room can see you in the shower The room is so little and our room was the biggest they had There is no Minibar in the room Nice modern hotel but more suited for business travel if you are travelling alone,1
No Negative all services and staff were excellent,1
 Shower was dirty cracks peeling paint in the corner of the room by the bed in room 101 No complimentary bottled water which is something some may take for granted nowadays  The nicest most comfortable bed in a hotel that I ve stayed in this year Great location around the corner from Earl s Court tube station with services into Leicester Sq in minutes ,0
 Breakfast was Expensive Staff were excellent hotel was of very high standard location was good ,1
 No bar fridge in room Excellent value for money,0
 Everything else The hot tap coming off in my hand as I started to fill the bath issuing a geyser of water which I managed to stop by screwing the tap back but burning my hand in the process The excessive heat and lack of ventilation in the room and throughout the hotel Nothing except location,0
 Bit pricey but not too bad considering it is Paris after all  Location is good room was fantastic Great facilities in the room including microwave kettle fridge and coffee machine ,1
 One member of staff was rude when we came in to check in so we moved to another person and the transport from airport to hotel the guy was also rude told us to get of the bus because we hadn t asked if we could go on but we just followed everyone else and we was there before some of the other people so had to mKe our own way to the hotel it should be properly organised rather than just deciding who goes and who doesn t it should be who as be waiting the longest not who gets on first Roof top view and restaurant cleanliness of room and hotel,0
 The room was unclear a little run down and I didn t feel we got our full value for money  The downstairs of the hotel was immaculate and the staff and location were superb ,0
 Language barrier with reception staff and not helpful No previous warning of the big renovation going on at hotel which we were told will be going on for next couple of months I don t mind a small room but this was basically a single with two beds pushed in hardly any floor space to move around Not able to open bathroom door more than half way as the beds were in the way and low ceiling Would have been totally unsuitable for a large person I sent an email to the central booking team on our return and nearly a week later have not even recieved an acknowledgement back General impression is they couldn t care less once they have your money  Set back off road so quiet Bed very comfortable and nice modern bathroom with plenty of toiletries ,0
"We stayed at the Intercontinental Times Square over Thanksgiving week and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect if you are there to see shows. We saw four Broadway shows and we were able to walk to all of them easily. The room was lovely and the service was excellent. My only complaint was the lack of a mirror in the room (only in the bathroom). Also, dinner in the restaurant was wonderful. It's not inexpensive, but definitely worth the money.",1
 Horrific Don t  Nothing,0
 No entertainment Location,1
 no lobby old furniture you dont get what you see on the internet i will rate it as 2 or 3 stars max very expensive room with terrace was a joke  Well located ,0
No Negative Everthing is amazing ,1
 Fridge wasn t working but fixed in good time Floor not too clean in room  Helpful staff Good location for Metro,1
 very old BUilding and old furniture in the rooms Breakfast is OK but overpriced WiFI was not working connection bery bad  location is OK,0
 Room and area Booked hotel because of its proximity to Wembley Not a particularly good area restaurants nearby ok No window in room and therefore no view and felt like a cave Also smelt mildly of damp Breakfast good,0

 Pushy staff no hot water Good standard of hotel,0
 room was quite small and cramped but wasn t a major problem 20 extra per hour to check out later looked very nice and posh inside comfortable bar open all night for room service,1
No Negative We were lucky enough to have a room upgrade the communication beforehand was very good we were even able to check in early as we d arrived ahead of schedule Check in and out was smooth All facilities we used were clean tidy and well maintained Staff very pleasant and professional ,1
 staff not friendly not helpful microwave not functioning shower cubicle flooded drain pipe stuck Air conditioner not cold at all and water keep dripping fr the A C breakfast lousy only bread butter  Location,0
 haven t seen a tinier room no Air Con and the window doesn t open the view was some construction material the interior of the room was also very poor more like a storage No Positive,0
No Negative Great location super modern brand new,1
 Breakfast very poor Guess must pay for Parking Rooms are smallNo Positive,0
 It was aiming for high class but just missed the mark and appeared a bit underfinished The first room we had was very dark and overlooked the centre carpark so we asked to be moved which they did and had a better room which was helpful  Nice sized rooms for London though it was a bit further out but still short distance to west London There was a good gym and spa facilities which was a bonus Staff were helpful Good sized bathrooms Nice White company toiletries Nice cocktail bar overlooking the Thames ,0
 The remodeling that was going on in the lobby area but it should be done by now  Friendly staff great location within walking distance of many sights RER train to airport only about 2 blocks away ,1
 Everything was terrible Nothing 2 small unclean no service you do everything yourself,0
 Warning Not a family friendly hotel There are several clubs that are very loud at night We even changed sides of the hotel and rooms since we were up from 1 30am 6am with the club base vibrating up the walls On the street side it s also very loud and we ended up checking out early The hotel is not near any of the scenic city stops  The property has a spa,0
 Small room no slippers or bath robe  Clean comfy good location,0
 Spa was extremely small Too many people and stressful Slamming room doors rattled the corridor at all hours  The room was nice and relaxing,1
 Our shower leaked on one occasion our whole bathroom and bedroom was flooded and the water even managed to get to the hotel corridors Hotel staff arrived immediately and cleaned everything up which was good  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay all staff were polite and welcoming breakfast was amazing extensive variety Our room had an amazing view 24th floor we were greeted with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries It was also a 2 minute walk from the beach and a 30 second walk to the shopping centre Tour bus stops right outside the hotel nearest station is across the road Definitely recommend this hotel ,1
 A bigger parking area perhaps I liked everything especially the quietness and the relaxing atmosphere ,1
 Such a very unpleasant stay There was no signs for clean my room or don t disturb t he room service brought it and then took it back The beds was really uncomfortable tgey charged me twice for one room my visa was authorise at the chick in and the chick out ,0
 Very old hotel Friendly staff and good location,0
 Check in was a complete disaster Staff definitely under pressure and unable to cope We were a party of 8 rooms and after queuing for over 1 2 hour found that none of the rooms were ready We decided to go to the bar to wait only to be told that we would have to queue again to find out if our rooms were ready Appalling service and at 275 a night per room expect better  Rooms very comfortable,1
 7 for a tiny bag of crisps from the mini bar is steep even having regard to the usual mini bar mark up No Positive,1
 Possibly the overhead projector system could project onto a larger screen My colleagues near the back of the room found some of the wording on the projection too small Perhaps use a second projector and screen half way down the confernce room  The room was very roomy and comfortable The WiFi was very good indeed The conference facilities that we used were also very good The overhad projector failed but the support staff had a backup projector installed and working within five minutes The front desk staff were very helpful In particular they explained to us how to get to the Belvedere Palace via the Botanical gardens That made it easy and of course both are well worth the visit Do visit the upper Belevedere and look at the view from the top floor as shown in the attached photo ,1
 Club room is very shabby and grubby and is not fit for purpose The breakfast offering was very poor and inadequately stocked It is not worth the extra money and if anything is very inferior to the breakfast offering on the B B option  Location front desk staff very competent,0
 small room location,0
No Negative it s such a terrible experience,0
 Our room this time was smaller Breakfast,1
 Room size Room was fine and clean Bed was terrific ,1
"The room and hotel were as to be expected for the price - nothing special, but nothing to take issue with either. The hotel is actually farther from the airport than I had anticipated, which would have been okay except for the shuttle. It took a little under an hour from the time I arrived at the shuttle pick-up location to the shuttle actually arriving to pick me up and then we went to other terminals and rounded up various other guests meaning it was almost two hours before I arrived at the hotel. Those wanting a quick in-out or those arriving after a long journey like myself, might do better to either skip the shuttle or find a different hotel.",0
 Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again  Location is excellent,0
 Only thing to mention is that when I arrived in the room the aircon was on and the room was a bit cold  I always have a nice stay at Grand Pigalle ,1
 Very Noisy hotel could hear roof top bar in our 3rd third floor room at 12 45 am Changed too second floor then we could hear nightclub over the rd plus people in street shouting and fighting until 3 30am Thats when the the dust carts and cars started Got to sleep 6 30 am Breakfast was included in our stay however we were given a price list and were told if we had a full English then we would have to pay extra for anything else IE fruit cereal pastries or toast No Positive,0
 Too far from London downtown you have to change from train to underground then maybe more than 10 station to reach downtown Also it needs to renew the paints of the ceiling Good decoration and furniture Also breakfast was excellent,1
 I woke up at 5am by the noise of someone pushing a trolley on the way to the elevator A pity as the room was quiet blocking very well the sound from the outside though not from the inside The location,1
 Terrible wifi connection in room  Great location Nice big clean room Great breakfast ,1
 I would have liked a bath but the shower was ok and got me squeaky clean anyway  Very comfortable bed Very helpful Concierge staff Coffee machine and safe in room as well as an umbrella and slippers and kettle with free beverages Very pleased with my room I also love the fish tanks in the lobby very relaxing ,1
 Bedroom small and very dark Location good,0
No Negative Good friendly staff at reception and throughout the Hotel Good Quality and varied Breakfast Great view of Paris and the Eif Tower,1
 No air con room small airless Only one lift working If you wanted a cooked breakfast you had to pay extra and normal breakfast was not included either Facilities poor considering this is supposed to be a 4 Also no restaurant or bar How it got this rating I do not know  Breakfast area clean and tidy Food ok ,0
 Leaving Location and staff,1
 Noise of air conditioning and ventilation systems in room kept me awake Even switched off there was a drone Lights not working in rooms reported to housekeeping but not repaired  food in restaurant was very good ,0
 Beds are tiny Not big enough to share with someone else Very noisy and no air con so it s ridiculously hot in summer  Location is good ,0
 I found not everything was present in the room as described no dressing gowns or slippers the milk etc was not replenshed every day The walls in our room were very dirty the chair had cigarette burns The rubbish was not taken away each day  The breakfast buffet was very good ,0
 The room was hot and the AC wasn t working but on the website it states AC for your comfort Also what wifi the website states free wifi and the wifi didn t work at all when I notified the staff they informed us that there was nothing that they could do due to the hotel being at max capacity causing the wifi not to work I will never stay here again No Positive,0
 No Fitness Room The Staff was friendly and helpfull breakfast and dinner very good ,1
 Expected a bit more of the executive room There was no aircondition as advertised  Good overall experience The location was suitable given our needs Good access to restaurants shopping and transportation ,1
 Old Hotel the pitures are to good on booking the reallity is diferent No Positive,0
"We arrived with low expectations and were surprised by the poor service we received. The reception staff hardly spoke and didn't seem to want to answer a simple question asking directions. The room was ok, but was very hot compared to the cold temperature outside. The shower didn't work properly (hot water on full with cold just turned on, and shower head stuck). There was also the continuous sound of the elevator going all night in our room.",0
"This hotel is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. Staff is rude... Rooms and bathrooms are FILTHY. Very dirty, dusty, moldy. Would never stay again.",0
 No complaints  Location service and facilities ,1
No Negative Excellent breakfast all organic comfy beds clean modern showers A C They even loaned me a charger for my phone after I noticed my new one wouldn t work in Amsterdam They were pleasant and helpful but not chatty That worked for me but my colleague likes a chatter so depends on your personality ,1
 We did not have the best experience Rooms were not cleaned properly staff were rather standoffish and unpleasant at times Definitely did not feel particularly welcomed and most definitely would not return We should have stayed in the Barcelona Princess across the road  We did appreciate the good location next door to a great shopping mall and right next to a metro stop that led straight into town ,0
 I don t know where to begin with this rubbish 4 star place There is free wi fi but it doesn t work It only works in the lobby Room was filthy outdated with torn bed sheets Shower was constantly changing from very hot to cold and there is nothing the could do to fix it This level of rubbishness is something you expect from hotels in Greece not Barcelona We originally payed for 5 nights and left after the first to a different hotel Don t choose this hotel regardless of the rate or deal you get  Close to the beach but that s where everything good ends with this place ,0
No Negative Great price and location Upgraded to a club room Beautiful bathroom and really comfortable bed For my next trip to London I will check this hotel first for availability and price ,1
 When I got there the man at the reception didn t know I was by myself there was some sort of mix up and as he showed me the room he was wondering if he should take off the sheets from one side of the bed since I was by myself I found this extremely unwellcoming Luckily he left the sheets but took away the extra towels  The room was lovely spacious and beautifully decorated Great value for money and excelent location ,1
 Rooms are quite small and compact for single but minor issue They didn t replace my tea but they are forgiven this time  Very nice helpful and friendly staff overall Clean and lux hotel with a pretty private garden area Peaceful area hotel next to park which is great for walking Comfortable room with kettle for tea which was perfect for rainy days in Milan when I was there Walking distance to Duomo or metro if needed ,1
 this was not a 5 hotel more like a good 3  the bed was ok,0
 Room was really small for the price Didn t expect a huge room but this felt cramped with 2 people  Cool hip hotel with great decor loved the circus theme Bar upstairs was great for a nightcap the bartenders were super nice even with it being very busy ,1
 We were not happy with the sink  Location was superb Breakfast was great Nice coffee and helpful staff I recommend this hotel with the kids We are planning to stay in other Indigo s ,1
 The POOR service in the restaurant on the Saturday night There were only two staff on to manage everything  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful Nice room too ,1
"Small room (Room ---) with extra small bath. In the bathroom, the cold and hot labels should have been relabeled 'pretty hot' and 'very hot'. Cold was N-A.",0
 Free breakfast The poppyseed bread and nutella in the morning ,1
"The hotel itself is fine however, the front desk personnel needs a little more experience. It took more time than necessary to check-in even though it was not busy. In the morning, we had scheduled the shuttle to pick us up that afternoon from a nearby meeting center and it took more than -- minutes after the scheduled time plus several calls to get the van there. The people are nice, though. I had dinner at their restaurant and the food was good. The coffee in the room is awful. I don´t know how new the hotel is but have the feeling that these kinks will get ironed out with time.",0
 Staff on reception when we explained something to them there manners left a lot to be desiredNo Positive,0
 Breakfast was expensive I paid extra for the fruit but didn t get the twin beds I asked for bed was ok Fruit bowl and coffee in room ,0
No Negative Everything,1
 the room was soooo small like the smallest room ever and i asked the conceirge to keep my bag for one week because im going on a trip and coming back to the hotel so they charged me 108 pounds for that while other cheaper and smaller hotels do it for free when i arrived to the hotel no one showed up to take my luggage so i carried them by my self from the taxi to my room on the 8th floor  Only the location,0
 The room smelled of cigarettes basic breakfast furniture worn out dirty windows  Location was perfect for visiting Duomo ,0
 The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy No Positive,0
 Basement room was under a bar Very noisy Cleaner cleans at 3am Horrendous Could hear Hoover banging and very squeaky floorboards Very tired in the morning  Tube station was walking distance ,0
 small rooms equipped basically the location is great,0
 couldn t log on to the internet even though is was specified as accessible Quiet clean helpful friendly staff,1
 The hotel is not fully equipped No bath rope and slippers Iron and ironing board have to be shared  The location is convenient to move from point to point ,0
 Nothing View,1
 Staff at check in process was not exact We were 3 people already book for 2 room one under my name one with my boss name and the she doesn t check all the details we just got one I ask we were already book for 2 room from booking com its is ok if we canceled one do we still got free charge She say OK no charge and we got one with extra bed we Love NH but NH Krasnapolsky is better  close from everywhere ,1
 Staff not helpful I checked out the night before so I could get away in the morning as there are queues a reception They told me I d have the bill emailed It wasn t and I ve called 4 times since to be told the bill will be emailed I m still waiting for the bill  the bar area was comfortable,0
"The area around the hotel is awful, but I had expected that. The room was in bad shape: wallpaper was peeling off the walls. The advertised """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free internet"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" didn't work at all. Out of four elevators only two were working. The valet couldn't locate our car for quite some time when we checked out. I wasn't at all impressed.",0
 Price of breakfast Location and room facilities,1
 The bedroom furniture is ugly old and decaying  Staff is lovely helpful and smiling all the time ,1
 Service at breakfast waiters kind of disappeared Sterile dining area Stayed 2 nights standard room had whistling sound in bathroom deluxe room had faint unpleasant sounds We each only had 1 pillow  Location Concierge was very helpful and went out of the way to help on a phone call ,0
 charged me 50 pounds for deposit which they said would give me back 3 days later its been a month and im still waiting for my money location,0
 I would stay there again my next trip to London Loved it  Nice appointments Everything in place and the staff warm and friendly They took nice care of us when our drain didn t work and upgraded us to a much nicer room Loved how accommodating ,1
 Free Breakfast does not cover room service a service charge not mentioned in any correspondence they wanted to charge an 22 each Check in and room service staff unfriendly Room was dated and had broken tiles in bathroom nasty shower they messed up a friends twin room so they had a king and a lumpy fold out couch Location friendly bar and housekeeping staff,0
 No tea making facilities in bedroom We had to order a pot of tea for two from room service at a cost of 7 00  Fantastic location Very comfortable bed Well stocked minibar ,1
 Cleanliness of the room was lax Old stale milk inside the cupboard to the mini fridge Also the carpet was frayed in the corners especially by the sliding door to the bathroomNo Positive,0
 The staff where very in helpful They put us in a horrible room the first night without air conditioning and next to a generator They refused to move us and put a portable fan in the room It was a horrible stayNo Positive,0
 A bit dated Location was perfect and the food was excellent,1
 the hotel needs maintenance floorboards were peeling or had water damage air con wasnt sufficient would rate at lower end of 4 star Would recommend their H10 Montcada hotel instead although pricier  nice and helpful staff saving grace for hotel decent location ,0
 The bed provided was very small and only just large enough for 2 relatively small people to sleep in It was certainly no more than 4ft wide and this is not something I am used to  The hotel is in an excellent location,0
"I try to stay at the Alexis every time I come to Seattle. It is probably my favorite hotel on earth (which pains me to say, because I love many) but this one is special. Lovely decor, perfect location. Great food at the Librarie Bistro and Bookstore Bar. I truly feel at home there. It is Kimpton perfection. I do wish they'd update the cardio machines in the gym, but everything else I would keep the same for eternity.",1
 Bathroom ventilation running loud all night no way to turn it offNo Positive,0
 Room temperature was too hot and couldn t adjust Hence had a really bad nights sleep No Positive,0
 sagged bed room and bathroom,0
"Bad location, really nothing is convenient walking distance. Literally sandwiched between what looks like to be freeways. Took room service -- minutes to bring us a menu (our menu was missing from the room). The bed and quick elevators, and some friendly people seem to be the only thing that are the pros about this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for over - or - nights at the most or else you start to feel trapped if you are without a car. TV's in room are way out dated. If you have a choice...stay somewhere else.",0
 We booked the hotel three months ago only to arrive and say the hotel was fully booked and we had to move from the booked double superior rooms to a single superior room the bed was 3 4 not a double as initially stated when we asked and with a 6ft partner it was not the ideal scenario we agreed to the change as we knew another hotel that short notice was going to be impossible without paying a lot of money but I am unimpressed and will not be returning as I paid for a luxury room and instead was left with what reminded me of a student halls room which was bang in front of the lift so meant we heard whenever anyone used it No Positive,0
"Colors:
For sure, psychedelic to say the least, but in the end the colors just mask an attempt at poor renovations.
Pool:
Cold, cold, cold and full of colors, (see above)
Room:
Dark, poorly renovated but clean. Weird window coverings, did I say dark?
Bed:
Comfy, headboard making noises at any time with ANY movement, not necessary “THAT” movement, clean sheets.
AC:
Barely adequate (October!) hate to think about June or July.
Room service:
Just Ok, did not replenished many of the items like coffee or cups
Roof top:
Spectacular, use it!!! Drawback, you have to use the slowest elevator on earth to get there.
Restaurant:
Stay away that is all I have to say. You have been warned.
Overall:
At about $-- a night it is a great deal.",0
 The immediate area is undergoing significant regeneration work but once in the hotel you would not know this  The staff are very friendly and professional This a modern well presented hotel The room was very clean comfortable and spacious Across the road from a tube station and 10 minutes walk from the Palace of Westminster ,1
 The wifi did NOT work properly most of the time probably too little bandwidth for all the customers Breakfast was basic and definitely NOT worth 13 Euros  There is a metro station of line 4 directly in front of the hotel this takes you into the heart of Paris within 15 minutes ,0
 We only spent two nights I wish it had been longer  The room was spacious the bed was a perfect sleep there was air conditioning it was quiet the breakfast was a great variety of fresh fruit baked goods cereals eggs etc The staff was very friendly helpful and gave great tips of where to go ,1
 The bed was on casters and had no headboard so the pillows ended up on the floor The menu in the restaurant was very limited Only three main course items Got a kettle but nothing to go with it The pool closed at six pm So a swim before dinner was out  Not a lot Just an average hotel at an inflated price ,0
No Negative we got the place on special without a breakfast deal would not have been able to afford otherwise room was very good helpful friendly staff,1
No Negative One of the best hotel breakfast I had,1
 Bathroom was gross and it was so loud Paper thin walls  Great location ,0
 We didn t have the air conditioner work in the room we were in  Location was great and parking was excellent We were to have air conditioning and it did not work in the room which than made the location extremely noisy since we had the window opened but was ok ,0
 Coffee place closed bit of a transit to the city but metro station isn t far and free shuttle to get there  Big pillotop bed cool rain shower,1
 Slow and confused reception Comfy bed,1
No Negative Convenient location ideal for Knightsbridge tube stop and Harrods ,1
 The bed was 1m80 But so were the sheets so the sheets were NOT big enough for two people There were a lot of hairs and remains of soap in the drain of the shower and the lavabo  The staf were very friendly The location of the hotel was great ,0
 the quilt is not really good it is a litte wet  the location is really good ,1
 After a long day shopping we decided to have a drink in the bar but not for long 2 mice running about  Location was good ,0
 I don t like being forced to have a credit card charged with a deposit Very convenient for access to Greenwich and the City I stayed in this location before it became a DoubleTree and the most noticeable factor this time was the dramatic improvement in the manners and demeanour of the staff who could not have been more helpful,1
 The hotel is somewhat isolated from the town center and accessible primarily by ferry  The hotel is very modern and clean and the staff provides excellent service ,1
No Negative dunno why they whrite bad comments the hotel was perfect clean rooms with great staff keep it up idea hotel,1
 Pool is tiny Breakfast was mediocre  Good location for tram and glories metro stop,0
 Cleanliness decor looking tatty bathroom sealant messy scuffs on walls blind looked as if a dog had wrestled with it No draught beer in bar guinness was undrinkable Location modern ,0
 Took me more than an hour to get my room knowing that i ve reached at 15 00 Location,0
 aircon did not work there was a smell in the hall like damp carpet the beds were very uncomfortable its just not what i would expect from a hilton staff were very helpfull,0
 room was outdated location for our conference was excellent WIFI was good,0
 The hotel did not have 2 pounds change to return on my cash payment There are stairs between the street level and reception  The location Near bus stop Kensington high street has many good shops and restaurants ,0
 No parking and reception not well manned at check out time had to wait a long time The rooms in the new extension are much smaller especially the bathroom and have lost the character of the original building  I liked Chiswick and easy to tube into the centre ,0
 The bar is very expensive even for LondonNo Positive,1
 rooms are not clean enough breakfast just average location is bad car is a must not impressed at all even considering a dirt cheap price just average price value ratio  price is good free parking,0
 Tourist tax is not included into price Window could not be opened more Awful light in the room No slippers for the asked price Minibar is about nothing No Positive,0
 Given the May heatwave its a shame the hotel didn t offer a swimming pool roof bar The music likable funky and deep house dj set or remixed albums was a bit loud in the common areas which perhaps timing seemed to be for no ones benefit with an empty bar The room was soundproofed so I couldn t here this though The air conditioned rooms and bedding was a bit difficult to find the perfect sleeping conditions  The location and decor were contemporary and modern This was a new hip hotel and had a personality that could be seen through the decor Kitch and provocative furniture prints and artworks was a contrast to the outside The room was big bright clean and very well equipped and was able to have family 5 people in the room for a pre dinner drink with ease ,1
 Jamies Breakfast restaurant I have had better service and presentation of selection on offer in a Transport Cafe Just Take one item Fried eggs Pick one out of seven all stuck together in a frying pan nigh impossible This Restaurant needs a serious rethink Hotel was fine the room we had was adequate,0
 Wifi wasn t very accessible from the hotel room and only worked intermittently  Very accommodating for our infant Supplied a travel cot on request but also a baby bath which was a pleasant surprise Room was very spacious and clean Only five minutes from the beach and easy access to the city centre ,1
 Breakfast can be a bit better  Everything was just perfect Super friendly staff and great large family suite room Location was superb too ,1
 Bed was uncomfortable Bathroom was dirty People allowed to smoke inside hotel made our room smell terrible Location was great but noisy,0
 Front desk could have been more forthcoming but i did arrive late so perhaps that is a reason After asking they provided a second room it was then comfortable but with a room heater instead of central heating,0
 Internet access  The location ,0
 Probably the hotel s only fault was its lack of a computer accessible to guests  The breakfasts were splendid but what really set this hotel apart for me was its design modern chic with lots of edgy art works ,1
 The shower tray was full of the previous guests body hair which I had to remove before taking a shower The room was incredibly hot as the AC wasn t working The hotel needs updating on the interior fabric padded walls just hold dust this is NOT a 4 star hotel by far  The Staff were very accommodating and polite ,0
 Shower Great foyer,0
 Room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke and very tired decor  Convenient location,0
 The room was cold and it was only when we called the reception they turned the heating up We seemed to be unable to Location and staff,0
 Price of breakfast was rip offNo Positive,0
 Room was basic no air con bathroom needs modernising Nice hotel good reception area and dining room excellent location ,0
 Check in took forever a mini bar fridge that could not be used to actually keep anything cold so why bother having it and because the credit card I used whne booking was lost and replaced they had to refund me then charge me again and I m left incurring two additional lots of international transaction fees thanks  Great location and very close to the tube,0
 The bar is a bit dreary but the cafe section is beautiful bit of a mismatch Really friendly and helpful staff superb location,1
 The rooms are on the smaller side although I knew that going in  The excellent staff made our visit very pleasant The room was very comfortable and the location perfect as well ,1
 Limited space to move around for a couple with small suitcases Even with ac heating off constant noise running through the pipes causing a disturbed night s sleep  Great location close to Pimlico station and restaurants Clean rooms and friendly staff ,1
No Negative Beautifully decorated hotel which is great value for money and ideally located for the museums The staff were great and made the birthday weekend extra specially We would highly recommend this hotel ,1

 I appreciate that the hotel was very busy on the evening of our stay but the cleanliness of our room just wasn t really good enough for such an esteemed hotel There were long red hairs in the bed I m a brunette and there were plates with the previous occupants breakfast still on at our door These plates were still there when we checked out on the saturday Can t really comment on the rest of the facilities as no one appeared available to let me know how to use them I don t normally leave negative reviews but I thought you would like to knkw why I wouldn t be keen to return  Very handy for events at Wembley Appeared good value ,0
 Our room was not cleaned up until 4 pm I asked at the reception what was the problem and received an answer that room cleaning continues through 9 pm Cleaning lady approached us at around 7 30 pm We declined her services Next day when asked to call a taxi to the airport we were given a private car and the driver charged us almost twice as the regular taxi EURO 55  Location ,0

"We stayed at The Palmer House for three nights. The lobby is huge and beautiful. The check in was quick, we had called ahead requesting a room with two beds and were very pleased that was honored. We were put on floor -- which is the executive level. We didn't have the noise issues that others have mentioned except in the bathroom were you can hear your upstairs neighbors through the wall vent. If you are put on one of the executive floors that has nice perks that go along with it. Hopefully I can post a full trip report in a few days.",1

 they gave us 2 single bed to combine nice view,1
 The reception staff were efficient but not very friendly unlike the cleaning lady on our floor I was concerned about security as the reception was down steps from entrance and staff did not always sit at desk The door and access to all floors was easily accessible from the road this is presumably why a voucher system operated for breakfast We had no problems though The cable tv only worked on two days  The room was a reasonable size and clean with large en suite and large storage area Despite being next to shopping complex and busy Road hotel was quiet Breakfast was good served in pleasant room It is close to U bahn one stop from Westbahnhof ,0

 Pool was extremely disappointing and nothing like in the pictures having a pool was the reason we chose this hotel in the first place but it was a way too small and narrow to swim Also only a handful of sunbeds were available so half the people left the pool area or sat on normal chairs which is not too comfortable  Beautiful stylish lobby Friendly reservation staff ,0

 A kettle in a room would make the hotel more attractive good price quality ratio the room was big and old fashioned but lovely old fashioned I mean the room has it s character There are many places where you can eat nearby and tram station The palace and the center is 1 5 km away it wasn t far away for us ,1

"Stayed here on business, beautiful and huge building right in the centre of DC, (used to be the Post Office apparently) imposing corridors and large rooms with high ceilings tastfully decorated with all mod cons. Very comfortable beds and L'Occitaine products in the bathroom, good gym too. Can't comment on the value for money because it was booked through company but is probably priced for its location more than anything. Very friendly front desk staff and complimentary wine and nibbles served in the early evening. The lobby did seem to smell of food all the time though, because it was next to the restaurant. Great place to stay if you're in DC for a short trip.",1

 nothing very clean,1
 It was 30 degrees when we arrived at the hotel and the air conditioning in the room didn t work As this was the reason we booked this hotel we were very disappointed I went to reception twice to ask about it but on both occasions there was nobody there We spent the night very hot and sweaty and didn t get much sleep Not what I expect for 175 pounds per night After reading the instruction chart on the room wall it appeared that the system was being over ridden by a central control We were not happy at all  Good location Tube station is a 5 minute walk and can get you into Leicester Square within 2 stops Breakfast was basic but nice ,0
 Too noisy service too slow beds uncomfortable Location,0
 Our check in was delayed beyond 2pm but the guest services manager made up for that by providing us with complimentary breakfast for the 2 days we were there which I thought was very kind and lovely of her The location is excellent and the facilities are too ,1

 Super TINY room and even tinier bathroom Disappointed with the cleanliness sheets were never changed during my week long stay and it felt that the bathroom sink was wiped down in haste rather than cleaned Very laissez faire so don t expect a doorman to help you with luggage flagging down a taxi  Friendly staff and excellent location a few minutes walk to Liverpool St Station Loved the free films available to watch on TV and the free bottled water in the fridge Canteen area on first floor pretty cool and I appreciated my room being available for early check in on arrival ,0
 The place was extremely over priced for what we received We were put in a room located in the basement of the hotel that smelled like mold sewage The room was extremely small and was covered in mosquitos 10 dead mosquitos on the walls The staff offered to spray the room while we were out but left the dead bugs on the wall It was ridiculous for what we were paying I would never stay at this hotel again I am sure the rooms on the higher floors are better but if you are going to stay here I would recommend calling ahead to makes sure you are not put in the basement  The location was great easy access to Vondel Park and great restaurants and bars ,0
 The money in my wallet was stolen by their luggage guy during my stay It was about 500US dollars I asked for extending one night of stay and asked the front desk to move my baggage to the new room However the money in my wallet was disappear after I received my backpack It was a bad experience also there is always a bad smell in the room No Positive,0
"Stayed for - days in August.
Got here very late and the staff were quite friendly but not over the top. The room was very clean but seemed dark as there was only the one window. The location was excellent and I don't think it can be beaten.
It does, however, seem to lack atmosphere and cater for the Japanese market. Be aware that a double room here meant a twin room. As it was late we didn't query it as most US hotels have big double beds but these are definitely single! Just make sure you make it clear what you want.",1

"I was in room ----. You need to re do the bathroom. The sink is on the same side as the toilet, so you have to stand to the right of the sink and lean over. Very bad design.
A larger person could hardly use the facilities in that bathroom. Take away some of the back bedroom area and enlarge this area. This is my only complaint- but a big one for me (and I'm a very small person).",1
Good communication host. They answered my questions for understanding their place before staying.,1

 The room way too small no view the fridge didn t work drain in the shower didn t allow water to get away properly  Location,0
 Everything Cleanliss very bad Security Staff behaviour Nothing only location,0
 Breakfast not included in price of room Room smelled a little unpleasant this was probably due to the construction work in the reception and our room not having a window that could open Added to this it rained hard the entire weekend which not the hotels fault of course  Staff were friendly when we arrived a staff member came outside to help us with our bags and show us the alternative entrance as the hotel reception area and lobby was being modernised ,0
  It s modern brand new and is located next to the Underground ,1
 We were in Paris in the middle of the April so the center air conditioning system was not on yet so it was extremely hot the first night but then we were sleeping with open window and it was totally fine  Really great tea and snacks all day round for all the guests in the lobby amazing ,1

 Internet charge nowadays seem nonsense as well as special breakfast charge  I must admit that Leonardo Hotel Vienna is a decent city hotel perfectly suitable for business or solo travelers who would enjoy comfortable bed quiet hallways and simplicity The same very hotel I would probably choose when my business trips are tight and stressful My recent experience showed that this precise choice was not suitable for family travel as simple as it is ,0

 Steps down into the room were dangerous and annoying the decor in the room was very old needed updating i think it might previously been a hallway that was converted into a single room The bed position in the very tiny room m ade watching the TV very difficult a grungy hotel yuk Except for the ensuite that was great with a good shower The bed sheets were dirty and had to be changed when I saw them and asked for a change The smell of whatever chemical they were using on my floor was pungent overpowering and possibly toxic  It was close to Paddington station and the bathroom was newish and clean ,0

We turned right around and told the front desk about it and were told """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we don't have bed bugs."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" They were good about giving the refund which was nice.
The room was really worn down. Everything smelled like lysol and the base board was unpainted wood. Aesthetic matters. Also probably haunted. Will not stay in the future",0

It was walking distance to Wall Street and next to Century --. WOW! Commuting to NEWARK was easy via PATH.
I get upgraded to junior suite but overlooking at the --- site. The bed and pillow was GREAT! Breakfast was disappointed. 
Our flight back to London was -pm. So, we checked out and left our luggage with the Bells. However, instead of putting our luggage securely in the locker room, it was just left out in the hotel lobby for - hours!!!! Luckily, they were NOT stolen. Trust me, if we were not rushing for the flight, I would have made a BIG COMPLAINT on that.

 The only blip was that we put a pair of shoes outside our room to be cleaned in a bag we found in the room provided for that purpose but when we looked outside the next morning the bag was not there neither was the complimentary Times we had ordered A call to reception quickly resolved this however shoes Times were brought to our room the shoes had been cleaned very well  An elegant hotel with its tall atrium Our room was spacious well appointed The location very close to Marylebone Station was excellent for us as we were catching a train at that station the next day ,1

 promised alternative breakfast at early departure NOT provided staff only speak spanish location near airport shuttle,0
 We asked a staff member in the reception if we could use a meeting room to do a Skype call early in the morning She just answered Why can t you do it in your room Because we want to look professional when meeting with clients and one of us was still sleeping in the room  Location perfect Public transport just 3 minutes from the hotel Building is nice and clean Modern and good comfort View from the top floor is nice ,1

 Relatively small rooms Every day several times the electricity lights went out Internet quite slow  The staff was friendly helpful and professional The rooms have a nice modern touch There is free internet included Quite location but still close to the Champs Elissee and the metro station at the place de Charles de Gaulle ,1
No Negative Location excelent Clean Restaurant and bar perfect,1
 We reserved two rooms one of which is a deluxe double room with a bathtub which is recorded on the Booking com s confirmation document However there was no bathtub in the room and the staff at the front desk told that it was a pity that Booking com showed incorrect information on web and there was not such room available for us After a discussion they offered a higher rate room with a bathtub We enjoyed London trip very much but did not enjoy the discussion We stayed at the room paying extra charge but for us it was not a pleasant experience and the explanation of the staff at the front desk was not trustworthy nor reliable  The location was very good ,0

 Reception staff were very unfriendly when checking in and had issues when trying to park as expected me to park in a very small space I have a large car which was never going to work as another car had parked shockingly in the space next to where I was asked to park which wasn t an actual parking bay but a spare small place  Good location for our needs and very clean and tidy ,1
 The organisation of this place was ridiculous Was given the wrong room in fact we had entered a room that was already occupied the ticket for room service wasn t taken and the toast on our breakfast wasn t even toast it was bread Absolutely disgusting They kept giving us the wrong keys for the rooms eventually after 45 mins we was put in the right room not what we had chosen but it did  Nothing it was awfawl ,0
 The room was very small and stuffy There is hardly any space to move around  The location of the hotel was the best ,0

 The bed was not great too soft and was two beds pushed together which meant we kept ending up in the gap in the middle Also the touchscreen for turning on the bathroom light was a bit annoying after the initial coolness wore off  Hotel is excellent in nearly all aspects location staff facilities Our room was on the 10th floor offering spectacular views of London right from our bed ,1

The history of the hotel is all it can live on, the rooms are dated and the carpets in all areas are disgusting.Most areas are dark and only one lift was working,and that seemed to be struggling with the demand. The hotel looks great from the outside,worth a visit for the history, but would not want to stay again. On a positive note, the bell men and receptionists were very good and helpful and the staff in general are good, and the hotel is on the walk of fame and - mins from Chinese and Kodak theatre.",0

 The single bedroom was so small and there were barely any space to put the luggage I had to put my luggage against the door to create more space in the room It felt like there were lack of design plan for storage space had been put into the room since putting the luggage against the door would be considered a safety hazard but it had to be done to be able to open the bathroom door The wall desperately needs to be fixed and the curtain needs a little bit of vacuum done Also I rarely saw any staff on the front desk which is kind of frustating when you need their immediate assistance  Newly upgrade bathroom,0

"Trying to find a cheap place (near Downtown) in New York city is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. This place though was a great fit. I was traveling for a conference, so all I really needed was a place to sleep. The rooms are -quite- small, the name 'Pod' is not just a clever name ;). The bathrooms were also very small, but the towels were fluffy and comfortable. Wireless was also provided, and they had an iPod dock radio for all the Mac people out there. They had storage underneath the bed, which was enough for my few days stay. Plenty of bars and restaurants around me, and I felt safe. 
Neat hotel, good for travelers in the big apple on a budget.",0

 The only hotel on my trip through Europe and UK that did not provide free wifi I pointed out to the girl on reception it was advertised as free wifi on booking com and she very reluctantly gave me a password to use in the downstairs bar area only but she was not very nuce about it at all My room also overlooked the office block very close next door so I could not open the curtains in my room for privacy reasons Great breakfast ,1
 Asked for early check in and a quite room as my wife needs rests during the day arrived and was told no rooms available before 2pm then given one at the back of the hotel right next to a very busy main rail route with constant train noise and room was very hot so had to keep the window open as air conditioner was very noisy so had nearly no sleep mentioned this when checking out and got no apology or recognition that there was something wrong Breakfast was over priced for what was on offer won t be staying there again We felt we were brushed off by the staff when checking in and when discussing the room at check out  Nothing,0

 Our gripe was that the room we got was not half a nice as the pictures on the website I m an early riser and picked this hotel partly because there was a nice looking armchair in the room for me to sit and read on There was no chair in the room at all meat I had to sit on bed which disturbs my wife who likes to sleep in on holiday There was no view of beach or balcony either as in pictures  Location was excellent Barcelona just a fantastic place to spend a long weekend There are some lovely caf restaurants just outside the hotel Short walk to fabulous beach ,0

"Older Embassy Suites just south of Town Lake. Undergoing renovation (they warned us). They charge $--.-- a day for self-park in adjoining garage. Breakfast horrible (with hours old sausage).

 Messed about at check in three times and couldn t access my room until 3 30 even though check I m was at 2 I was told my room wasn t ready as someone was still in it Also they apparently upgraded me but didn t tell me and the room they d upgraded me to wasn t ready In the end they gave me my original room none of this made sense The building work let s the place down its a mess and quite noisy The staff don t seem to know what they re doing I was told there was nothing to do near the hotel and the place isn t friendly  Lovely view,0
 The decoration was very dated with dull lighting and carpets peeling of the floor of which i tripped over one on the 6th floor It is in desperate need of refurbishment The downstairs lobby was quite nice thought The bathroom was a bit dated too I was very surprised that this hotel was a hilton  The beds were comfortable ,0
 Fire alarm at 2 45am Small but well appointed Great staff professionalism and yet amenable Lovely for the purpose ,1
 Look out for service charges automatically added to your bill Beakfast quite expensive  Small rooms but perfectly formed Good location Breakfast excellent ,1
 Small rooms Very helpful staff,1
 We considered the cost of the breakfast expensive so we had breakfast out every morning  The staff at reception were very welcoming and helpful The bedroom and ensuite areas were cleaned to a very high standard every day ,0
 We requested an early check in but none of the rooms were ready However we went back an hour later still early and our room was ready It was a little further away from the station than we thought but still not very far The shower was not powerful at all and this was the biggest negative really  The bed was very comfortable and the decor of the room and hotel in general was very nice There was a good range of toiletries hot drinks and they even had things such as slippers vanity kit dental kit shaving kit and a little pad and pen which I thought were nice touches There was also a very tastefully stocked minibar which was quite reasonably priced ,1
 Not sure about value for money  Very nice hotel polite staff beautiful rooms and excellent location right outside the tube station,1
 The hotel reception were very dismissive and not accommodating at all Very much felt like the gentlemen did not want to talk to us or adhere to our request Very disappointed and felt quite discriminated At one point the gentleman had said we was disturbing him from doing his work and then mumbled under his breath As if paper work was more important than the customer in front of you awaiting check in No Positive,0
 The lift wait for hours and then took the stairs as many other guest In this hotel they have a problem with lifts 2 small pools at different floor level Slept very well room totally dark ,0
 I felt let down by the hotel Definitely for the price it offered very little No swimming pool just a jacuzzi which is open after 10 am The steam room was smelly Smell was something like fatty food Was really unpleasant Most spas and steams room rooms smell of eucalyptus or essential oils  The bar has an amazing view ,0
 The breakfast was not OK butter offered was old yoghurt did not look fresh anymore No Positive,0
No Negative Bed very comfy as was the pillowsh10,1
 This is a two star hotel masquerading as a four star Small overheated rooms Dodgy wi fi No minibar Nowhere to sit unless you favour a sort of stool that had obviously escaped from the bar of a local cabaret The breakfast room was closed for refurbishment so le petit dejeuner had to be eaten in the room with the tray dumped on the bed because the only table was too small and attached to a contraption that looked like it had failed pole dancing school Memo to proprietor you need more than a breakfast room upgrade to justify your stars unless they are small red dwarves  Very friendly helpful staff ,0
 The other staff at check in were really bad The general manager and the concierge were fabulous,1
 See above The apartment was in a great location overlooking the canals The only drawback was that we needed to negotiate steep stairs as there was no lift This was an issue as we were at the end of a 7 week holiday with lots of luggage Thankful that we were only on the first floor It would have been nice if we were aware of this from the beginning ,1
 common spaces needed to be cleaner close to victoria,0
 All equipments are closing very early For example the coktail bar is closing 9PM and the swimming pool at 8pm As a result we couldnt enjoy them although they were the reasons why we booked this hotel In our room walls were dirty and the furnitures were a bit old and scrapped Too bad that you have to pay that price for the location No airport shuttles either  Location,0
 There s a 5 minutes walk to the nearest Underground station but it s not so bad  Everything is brand new there s complimentary coffee tea in the dinning area and a fully equipped kitchen in every suite Oh and they have the cutest hotel dog ever ,1
 2 of our 3 rooms had very restricted showering facilities both 5th floor rooms One of our group couldn t even shower as shower too low ledge restricted movement The other 5th floor room smelt very damp Staff were excellent and accommodating esp as we arrived earlier than the check in time Noon checkout also great,0
 Room was extremely small single room and I thought the place felt very impersonal Good value by London standards Very quiet also and I had a good night s sleep,0

 Not enough staff on bar in the evening when we returned to hotel had to wait about half an hour to be servedNo Positive,1
 My colleagues were sad because there were no crepes on the last day there s not loads of choice for breakfast which makes 18 a bit much  Nice hotel clean modern We liked the location shops and restaurants within walking distance ,1
 The toilet was prepared for handicapted people which is not bad at all but the shower was not well protected so every shower meant water all over The people and breakfast were nice,1
 Coming home  Everything excellent location condition of rooms ,1
 I arrived at the hotel late in the evening after a very long day of business I had to wait 10 15 minutes to check in After this room service was particularly slow Not a great experience for a weary traveler  Good overall value in a good location ,0
 Booking force me to upgrade room pay extra 20 night Room in middle floor is very noisy you will hear gust argue with reciptionest regularly Room cleaning till 2 00 pm not clean room and I have to request from reception to clean the room Stairs to get inside hotel so you have to carry your stuff bags baby stroller wheelchair Breakfast area very small and coffe cup smell Do not forget to return back all room key or receptionist will chase you Coffee machine on lobby Near central station,0
 Room extremely small This is not a 4 star property as advertised I want rate it admire than 2 star No Positive,0
No Negative safe and comfortable,1
"Loved this downtown location, close to good restaurants and everything downtown. Beautiful, comfortable room-love those sheets and comfortable bed. Very clean, appealing hotel. Don't spend your honors points for a view though-wasn't worth it. Great gathering places in the bar and the patio deck. The concierge was very helpful with recommendations. Would definitely stay here again. We took the train, which was not for the feint of heart-lots of steps and walking-but the most reasonable transportation from the airport.",1
 too old decoration and furnitures are bit of worn out a little bit smell and AC cannot even be switched off  close to public transport and good parks around ,0
 Old doors problems to open them No AC in the rooms I was told to pay 40 additional euros to get AC Breakfast 5 out of 10  Location ,0
 The check in starts too late at 15 00 so it can be a little bit annoying  Nice breakfast included in the price Good location Everything super clean ,1
 Worst stuff ever very impolite and aggressive They did not bother to say goodbye when living or ask how was our stay The hotel definitely needs renovation Bad smell in the rooms The price is way to high for what they offer  ,0

No Negative Just a lovely small modern hotel very convenient tram and underground outside door ,1
 Our room was outdated and very boring and sort of depressing we didn t want to spend a minute there I think hotel should invest more in improving rooms rather than focusing so much on the lobby after all it s the room that we pay for  Hotel lobby and restaurant area was nice the first thing you notice when you enter the hotel are the most beautiful orchids in the lobby and reception area Great location ,0
 A bit far from city center Old interior Bed not really comfortable  Location of hotel is not bad Close to tram stop WiFI available,0

"We recently stayed one night at the San Carlos and thankfully it was only one night. The hotel lost one of our room reservations, however the front desk clerk was polite, apologized and corrected the mistake. 
Overall, I think the hotel staff is quite amiable.
This hotel has several big problems, however. First, you have no control over the heat or air conditioning in your room. We melted from the heat the night was stayed. Secondly, there was no water pressure in the bathroom sinks on either floor where we had rooms reserved. Lastly, the rooms are very small (although I am accustomed to small rooms in Europe).
Overall, unless you are at a convention in downtown Phoenix and need to save money, there is no reason to stay at this hotel.",0
No Negative The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was perfect,1
 An overrated 4 star property Do not have basic amenities such as iron for pressing adapter for charging plastic glasses for drinking uncomfortable beds and air con not working No dining facilities 2 star hotels better Nothing at all,0
 bathroom broken Lights was not working and toilet twice under repair Rooms not available and no flexibility to arrange room sooner room was nice and spacious ,0
 This is not a 5 star hotel maybe in 1986 expensive very dated rooms and as for the bathroom I couldnt believe how small it was No Positive,0
 People around  Comfortable and near to the station ,1
 The hotel itself as well as the room were disappointing for the price The facilities room size and starchy towels do not reflect the rating Also what was considered a terrace is far from what you d expect Some of the rooms face onto busy bar streets which can cause disturbance during the night  The location was good Very central to many good restaurants bars and shopping streets Public transport was easily accessible Several sites in the city are easily reachable from the area ,0
 Wish it would ve been warmer so we could use the roof but obviously that s not in the hotel s control  The service was wonderful the restaurant was delicious the cocktail bar was very impressive Ohla was the perfect way to end our honeymoon ,1
 Mohamed at reception desk very unfriendly  Location,0
 Very basic furniture in the bedroom Breakfast was very busy On our first day there were not enough tables and staff cleared our table before we had finished On returning with a second course we found other guests seated there We had a problem in our room on the first morning but there was only a young member of staff on reception and we had to wait until after breakfast to get it sorted and only after we reported it a second time  The room was quiet which we asked for and the bed comfortable Staff were quite friendly Great location ,0
 Poor internet at pool side Good location 20 mins to Catalonya square helpful staff very good breakfast little pricy ,1
 Having booked and paid in advance for a deluxe double we were put in a shabby basement room which looked like a 1970 s guest house Stressed and unhelpful reception staff were not prepared able to give us another room and blamed booking com for getting the reservation wrong In our experience this is definitely NOT A 4star hotel No Positive,0
 Poor condition of the room Breakfast was also poor 50 daily extra charge for upgrade did not deliver a better room and aminities As I booked and stayed more than one time earlier this was the first time an upgrade was offered but not delivered as it should  Room facilities run down especially the water system ,0
 Weak WiFi in some parts of room Lack of space for luggage clothes Modern as seen in pictures Shower was great Quiet,1
 Felt a bit old and let down Roomy,0
 Double was 2 singles put together not idealNo Positive,0
 The rooms it s too small I like the location perfect place good for family,1
 The bathroom is a good size but unfortunately has very little shelving to place one s personal items The sinks although very attractive were round with nowhere to place soap  Excellent location close to centre of Milan Enjoyable breakfast that can be eaten in the garden Very comfortable bed Quirky decor ,1
 Not many things happening around the property on land in the river is wonderful Dinner at the bar with the view of the river boats passing by was great,1
 I paid by cash for my room on arrival and was Meade to feel like some lower class by the staff that was on the desk We was not able to order room service because we had no card but was able to go down and put a balance on to enable this fair enough  The Hotel was modern and comfortable,1
"I booked a downtown hotel on priceline and ended up at Gild Hall. I was not informed that the hotel is only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""under a soft opening"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and it showed! The front desk and the entrance are all temporary. The constant buzz of drills were evident as the hotel is still undergoing construction. The toilet would make strange noises each time it was flushed and the bathroom shower had a very slow drain. 
Decent size rooms, but the location is pretty much away from everything. 
Lots of work to be done to make this a better hotel!",0
 Bad attitude of foreign staff lack of serviceNo Positive,0
 The parking situation I was told I could park in a bay that I actually couldn t and received a Westminster parking ticket which wasn t compensated Fuming Bed was lovely shower great ,0
 Room was very small The foyer and the style of the hotel really good for the price,1
 Some reception staff do not have good customer service skills my room bookings were mixed up and my son was asked to pay again for the room I had already paid for which caused some embarassment after checking and confirming the room was paid for was no apology made just its ok the rooms were also miles apart as we were advised that one of the rooms had been rebooked so not great Despite this the hotel is nice the corcierge lads were very professional and the location is good  Good location comfortable bed spanear to room and facilities good ,0

 Two hours before my arrival they phoned me to inform that my room was not available and I had to move to another hotel in Marble Arch this was not acceptable with such a short notice so I refused and they assigned me an underground room with a small window on top no natural ligh and no chance to get fresh air into the room Position of the hotel cleanliness and staff,0
 Was charged double really hard to recover money poor service food was good,0
No Negative Very luxurious and large ,1
"I can't stop gushing about this hotel! Not only is the property first rate but the service was excellent as well. The historic Beaux Arts building has been meticulously restored and renovated (think Restoration Hardware all the way). The rooms evoke the era of when travel was exotic and luxurious! The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""steamer trunk"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" dresser and other details are wonderful. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious; the desk has ample workspace and is stocked with the basic office supplies. The manager called the room a few minutes after I had checked in to confirm that everything was to my liking. The only negative is the small, slow elevator (it looks like it is historic) and the charge for wireless access (waived for elite HiltonHonors members). Can't wait to return to Seattle and the Arctic Club!",1

 the rooms were very small and out dated it felt more like a 2star rather than a 4 star also the floor all creaked the bed was uncomfortable and we could hear the underground train from our room at night don t stay on the ground floor if your a lite sleeper staff were friendly breakfast was great only thing was the rooms were poor No Positive,0
 Central heating was a bit noisy during the night Breakfast didn t seem to offer a low sugar choice of cereal the bacon had been cooked some time earlier and had got a bit leathery the eggs overdone Having said that they did cook some fresh when I asked  They made a decent job of refreshing a 1960 70s building to bring it up to date the staff were attentive and I appreciated the choice of Scotch and Irish whiskies at the bar The bed was comfortable the bathroom clean and well fitted out ,1
 Pathetic service 1 person on night staff said person was high and could not function Pathetic client services still have not responded to my complaints  Nothing ,0
 room really small for priceNo Positive,0
 Terrible food Worst hilton i have ever stayed in Miserable depressing rooms  Nice staff,0
 Rather noisy airco solution was to cool the room during the day while we were away in order to have a quiet and cool nightrest Non optimal efficiency at check out We had to wait for over 20 minutes with taxidriver waiting for us because of a group of 4 people checking in  Spacious clean well equipped well sound isolated room Very good breakfast Helpful staff ,1
 The hotel was rather dark and dim It was not 5 star in my opinion Not good value for money  The bed was comfortable and everything worked as it should ,0
 very very small room and bad smell location,0
No Negative Great location very helpful staff Beds very comfortable and pillows were lovely spotlessly clean rooms Great breakfast with loads of choice loved the coffee machine ,1
 Not a 4 star Hotel Breakfast was chaotic There were not enough tables for all guests Breakfast is poor very small food selection not hot food choices Under the 4 expectation We wouldn t class this Hotel as a 4 The pictures on the website of the rooms and hotel garden are misleading Think it is over priced  We liked that it was central for everything museums shops restaurants public transport just around the corner ,0
No Negative Complimentary light breakfast was a great idea and we really enjoy one of the concept rooms ,1
We've just came back ftom ny. Rooms are quite comfortable and clean but need a renewal ( at least the bathroom). Wifi is not free (- dollars per hour) and at the reception - lobby there' s a bit of mess due to restructuring works. The aisles are old and 'sad'. It's near time square not at time square.,0
 Ensureing that late night revellers at 3am keep quiet as they are returning to their rooms Overall facility spacious room comfortable excellent staff support and friendliness,1
 Not very convenient for families with elderly people as there were very few cafes restaurants in the vicinity  Good value for money,1
 Bathtub was a bit shabby They could have cleaned more They didn t fill up shampoo  Lovely retro hotel Close to the tube station and the bus stops ,1
 A bar on rooftop terrace would have been lovely Came into Hotel after a day of sightseeing thinking we would have a drink 5 30pm in hotel bar and had to pick up phone to call a member of staff Nobody answered phone so gave up and we wasn t the only ones Not a lot left at breakfast at 9 30am No Positive,0

 The breakfast was appalling they ran out of some food we waited 1and a half hours for our food to arrive and not what we had ordered not enough staff on and not enough food so many people like us were complaining Nice big comfy bed,1
 Nothing particularly only comment would be breakfast was a little style over substance At first glance the menu looked limiting but if you asked for something they would provide it although marmalade was not available  Location is excellent in a lovely part of London within easy reach of Covent Garden theatres Chinatown and much more including two underground stations Room well appointed and very quiet for centre of London ,1
No Negative Great location nice room and friendly staff ,1
 No large towel Staff were helpful,1
 Everything The staff were not helpful the hotel was dirty none of the services of a hotel so known are convenient Worst stay ever I had to go out the whole day and come back for sleep only because I couldn t stand the hotel Renewing the hotel would be a good option demolishing it and rebuilding it maybe We had access to the lounge and omg the lounge The worst place ive ever been and i swear im not exaggerating We chose the hotel only because of the location and never expected it to be that bad will never ever recommend it  Nothing other than the location of the hotel,0
"Our first hotel of our trip, the Coventry was a welcome sight after the long journey from London. 
The hotel is a little basic but the room was big and equipped with everything you would get in a --- star hotel in the UK.
Requested a fridge to be put in the room for an extra $- a night. Useful for chilling drinks but a little noisy throughout the night.
Although out of the centre, the hotel was only a short walk from the Wharf and within easy of buses and trams.
Couple of pluses for use were -) the free parking as the charges advertised around the city appeared expensive and -) free Wi-fi in every room
Not luxury but if you plan on spending most of your time sightseeing then would definitely recommend it for value and convenience",1
 However it fails to reach 5 star status in almost every other key area Our air conditioning reported to housekeeping within 30 minutes of arrival was still broken 4 days later The restaurant is barely adequate we took dinner once and the charge of Euro 25 per person for a buffet breakfast is laughable when equally good if not better is available at half the price within 5 minutes walk The staff try to be helpful but often provided us inaccurate information The noise from downtown party people at the weekend went on all night and was highly intrusive even on the third floor  The key benefit of this hotel is its location Right at the heart of the old city it is within easy walking distance of most if not all key points of interest and decent restaurants,0
 costly car parkingNo Positive,0
 Room was dirty dated and I ordered a suite but they simply connected 2 rooms and then put 2 single beds together to make a double despite my request not to Certainly poor value for money Bed was extremely uncomfortable and totally uneven  The restaurant was nice especially the regency club area,0
 Not the type of boutique hotel I was expecting more for those who work and stay in London during the week  Was very clean and bed was comfortable and the room was air conditioned,0
 Very small room nearly don t have space to put our small luggages Clean room,0
 The evening meal at the rooftop restaurant was disappointing Given the quality of everything else in the hotel it didn t meet our expectations  Wonderful ambience in the hotel beautiful decor and furnishings in all areas and a fantastic rooftop terrace with pool ,1
 Smelled a little damp The duplex room option,0
 The room I was in 203 was unacceptably bad peeling wallpaper filthy sticky carpet and terrible bathroom with pink 70s lino and awful plumbing no amount of fancy toiletries can cover the awfulness of it No amount of traditionalism can justify the bad quality of the furniture wardrobe door would shut and blocked view of TV from desk Breakfast was overpriced and mediocre quality in old style British dining room all style but no substance Even the discount Booking genius price of 190 was excessive for the terrible quality I wrote directly to the hotel to provide this feedback a week ago but no reply so obviously they don t care about customer service and are in for one shot visitors To be avoided  Friendly staff and decent albeit dusty old world style public areas good location but negatives outweigh the positives ,0
 Walls are very light Could hear neighboring guests in their rooms Made for a night of disrupted sleep  Front desk service very welcoming,0
"This was my first time staying here and would probably stay here again as the location is very convenient for the types of activities I enjoy. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are very close -about a -- minute walk. Also in the vicinity is the Empire State Building which you may not know is open very late for visiting. Good pizza, deli's , and breakfast stops. There was an interesting looking wine bar right across the street that I regret not trying. The rooms are """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cozy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but can get very, very warm with no way to adjust the temp. except opening the window. And as another poster mentioned, the outside noise can be loud, but never did the inside noise of the hallway or slamming doors bother me.",0
"This hotel is nice, it is a great hotel to stay at for being at the park and listening to music in the summer. It is dated, and a little worn, but definitely a classic Chicago hotel. We loved it, and had great service.",0

 Looks nice and modern at first sight but no atmosphere and a lot of details showed if this hotel had had its best time Several damages in the room Not clean in front of entrance etc etc etc Slow reception desk Not worth its price at all No Positive,0
 I believe the hotel is in the process of updating rooms however they did not inform us that work would be taking place during our stay So it would be fair to say it was a surprise disappointing to be awoken at 9 45 on Monday morning to the sound of banging drilling when we were hoping to have a lie in prior to check out Also the room had a leaking kettle  They allowed us to keep our bags at hotel after check out Room was clean Located fairly close to the underground ,0
"For a Hilton, to be honest, you'd expect a little better. The room was ok. You have to be a contortionist to use the toilet and the curved architecture made for a relatively small room. Service was attentive and polite. For the price, I'd come back, but if I could splurge a little I might prefer to stay closer to downtown.",0
 Staff treatment Location,0
 The carpet in my room in the old wing was very dirty If you like the continental breakfast with eggs sausages etc thank there is a good choice If you just like bread pastries than breakfast is quite poor  The hotel is currently refurnishing the rooms Unfortunately I was not in a room in the new wing which was already refurnished ,1
 The room was not acccording to the photos online that trigged me into booking this hotel instead of another one that looked very nice to me So the room was a dissapointment but it was clean Really bugged me not to have nightstand and a plug in beside the bed Overall it was really nice and i enjoyed my stay  The staff is nice from my experiance I would think about coming back here ,0
"We missed a connecting flight and were given a room here by the airline. The quality of the hotel is below what I would have expected -- the building is old, and right next to the highway. My biggest complaint was that the hotel provides only sheer curtains - and a light from the parking lot was shining directly into our room all night -- I couldn't sleep under these conditions. Also a lot of highway noise.
The beds were actually pretty comfortable with nice sheets. However, I would only stay here if you are looking for something cheap and don't mind a lighted room at night.",0
 Bed uncomfortable and room small Breakfast was cold and service non existentNo Positive,0
No Negative Really nice hotel with good location near metro and walking distance to many things Breakfast Very good Lots of good restaurants in the area Nice roof terrace with small pool a Big plus on a warm day,1
 Staff rude and when I continuously refused to accept a room without a window they became aggressive to the extent that I said I would call the police Booked a room with a window and on arrival was told they had none available so was told I had to have a room without a window I refused and eventually had to pay to upgrade to a twin room which was a smoking room and stank ,0

"Stayed at the Dylan this past weekend. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was a good size (for NY) and was on a high enough floor that we couldn't hear the construction noises from the street below. The temperature control in the room didn't work the first night (it was a bit chilly) but was fixed within -- minutes of asking about it. GREAT location. Will be staying here again in May and I'm really looking forward to it.",1

"We stayed for six nights in June as part of our around the world holiday. We found all the staff friendly and obliging, especially the guy that got us our ice everyday...sorry didn't get your name but you were so obliging. We were happy with the rates and size of the rooms for a New York Hotel. Having the high ceiling and Juliette balcony added space to the room. Breakfast was included which adds to the value and the wine and cheese evenings were a lovely way to end to the day. With a subway station just across the block it was easy to get everywhere however as we like walking we had no problems walking up to Times Square. I would highly recommend",1

 The reception area was very tired the sauna area was very smelly as a group of two couples we tried to organise massages way in advance to be informed that the spa was an external company with only one therapist Not what you should expect from a hotel supposedly one of the best in Amsterdam  The staff were great and the location was perfect ,1

 The cups in the room were dirty also the mini fridge didn t work Aside from those minor issues we ve had a very pleasant stay  The place is very central in Amsterdam West which is a hip neighborhood of the city with a lot of restaurants and is easy to get to The rooms are clean and spacious by Amsterdam standards and the bed was very comfortable There s ensuite toilet and shower with towel and shampoo provided If you re there for Museums then this is also a great place to stay because Vondelpark and Museumplein are literally a stone throw away ,1
 I ve been struggle to call room service After I manage to speak to them through the reception and not directly they sent me my food but not as I ordered it so they sent me another I sat at the bar restaurant to eat I ve been there for 10 minutes and the girl at the bar was playing with her cell phone Then I decided to go and tell her that I wanted to order She was rude The food was average but the desert was very good The room fridge was empty No Positive,0
"This is a much older Hampton property and it shows. 
The Pros: 
Great Service – Front Desk folks were top notch 
Great Breakfast – Smiling Staff and a filling meal
Room Size – Great for a business traveler
The Cons:
The AC unit – This thing was LOUD. I could not continue my telephone conversations when the unit turned on. Forget about sleeping with it on. I thought about asking for a different room, but several people staying at the hotel commented that they too had a loud unit.
Smokey hall ways. They are trying to clean it up, but smoke scent still dominates
Weight Room – Really tiny. Treadmill, cross-trainer, and incumbent bike fill the room tightly.",0
No Negative Friendly and very helpful staff and great location to start your Viennese vacation Rooms are spacious and clean and the view was really a bonus if you pick the suite overlooking the city ,1
 Very thin walls You can hear the noise from the galleria in your room and we couldn t sleep very well House keeping failed to supply room with water or other amenities like toilet paper we had to ask every time Towels and bed sheets didn t smell very fresh and smelled weirer Very overpriced considering the level of service Centrally located near all main attractions,0
 More selection on restaurant menu  Comfortable beds clean rooms quiet at night tea and kettle in room staff always pleasant great location for main attractions,1
 The room was a bit too warm and we had trouble regulating the temperature One employee at the reception was a bit grumpy although the others were congenial  The location couldn t be better The breakfast was excellent There were sufficient electrical outlets in the room and a data connection I didn t use the wifi but my husband did and he said it was adequate ,1
"I must say I was disappointed with my stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square North given the high ratings it received so far. First, service was at best average (not enthusiastic as I had hoped for ). There were exceptions though - the travel -concierge desk and the chambermaids were great! All others, service was at best an okay. Room was average.
Breakfast was standard Hampton Inn fare - average breakfast.
Location though is pretty good - located at -th Avenue, close to the actions of Times Square (I just walked --- blocks to the hotel). Nearby the hotel (--- blocks north), there is a Chinese restaurant that opens till late serving pretty good and cheap Chinese fare which we frequent regularly.
Personally, I would prefer Hilton Garden In Chelsea.",0
 There is only a sliding door on toilets in the room could be a bit awkward for very new couples  Great lads at the bar They went out of their way to be as helpful as possible The hotel looks modern and is clean Loved the control panel for lights blinds do not disturb,1
 Could not use the discount re visiting nearby hospital because we booked with yourselves Only quota of towels for one person did not find out until late Building works going on with lots of dust I have a dust allergy so am still suffering The morning when we planned to have a lie in we were woken up by drilling Our room was by the lift so we heard voices all night long Very slow service in the restaurant Some food was cold Hotel was situated where we needed to be Room was comfortable and clean Breakfast was ok,0

 18 euros for breakfast was a bit too much especially because the food was cold We hadn t booked breakfast before hand and they offered us a special promotion 2 for 1 Got a feeling it might be something they offer all year round  We were really happy of our choice Service was on point and the roof top bar was a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing and shopping Room was quiet we stayed on the 5th floor and the bed was comfortable Would stay here again ,1
 very arrogant receptionist at arrival parking conditions poor and unsafe roomservice food served was barely eatable but prices at high level  View,0
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for - nights and - days, we were in business. The hotel rate was really expensive but considering the location it was good. The nightmare begins when the airconditioning failed to work, the door keys never worked, and the thing that really pissed me off was we ordered room service and paid cash, the room service guy claimed that we never paid him any cash and so was charged twice. I tried to report the incident, I left messages, passed on to different people and it took over a month for them to reply just to find out that they were not going to refund me the money. NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL, THE STAFF WERE SNOBS AND NEVER ORDER ROOM SERVICE!",0
No Negative The staff was excellent ,1
No Negative Good location close to nightlife spots The room was relatively big by london standards,1
 They lost our booking through you I had e mailed them that our trip had changed and we would only be there 1 night instead of two Pre paid for two of course I understood no refund but asked for maybe an upgrade to our room They found the reservation and agreed We would have a nice room It was no better that our two other visits In fact was smaller Construction going on for a remodel project Like the location and service but this time it was not good and would make me not go next trip to Barcelona Good breakfast and location near old town Third stay there,0
 no vegetables on the breakfast suggested but this is not so important  Very nice European hotel clean and pleasant ,1
 deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower  Room clean modern and made decent use of small space,0
 I don t know what a mature couple is but we are in our late 30s There was non stop loud pumping music in the lobby which we found annoying It s probably an occupational hazard for the receptionists noise pollution The penny pinching was a turn off since it s not a budget hotel For example they asked us to pay when we wanted a 30 minute late check out I think it would be much better for their reputation to say that the room was not available They also marked their shampoo as the best shampoo you re ever going to steal humor I don t get I found it cheap  The hotel was comfortable enough room was nice Location is excellent ,0
 It is pretty difficult to reach it when the metro is not running the hotel is located at the end of a metro line Absolutely no shop nearby if you want to buy something water for example please do it downtown There was a strange persistent unpleasant smell in the room situated on the first floor coming probably from outside Beds towels bathroom were utterly clean but we couldn t contain the smell even with closed windows Sorry for that otherwise the hotel meets high standards  A quality hotel with high standards Friendly staff good breakfast ,1

 Poor wi fi connection in room and not much better in lobby There were a lot of very noisy young children who were running around first floor lobby unchecked for a lot of Sunday afternoon  Reception and concierge team excellent We were looking after a tiered wedding cake delivered ahead of our arrival with their prior agreement They helped us look after it and deliver it safely to the wedding reception venue ,1
 Room size ungenerous  Staff helpful and friendly,1
 dirty as garbage 3 night stay and never clean my room and bathroom and never change sheets  Great location,0
 How perfect it was  If anything was worth paying for in my life it was this hotel I don t know where to start the welcome the perfect breakfast clean and ultra modern rooms the staff especially the reception I don t know his name but he Said he was from Africa It felt like a 5 star hotel I reccomend walking to Duomo 10 mins and to other parts go to Crocetta metro station only 4 5 mins away Milano is expensive so you will definetely leave a lot of money on accomodation but make sure its in this hotel ,1
 The room was small But that is common in Europe  Great location in the centre of London Easy to find Good access to tube ,0

 The air conditioning in our home wasn t working very well We had to turn it down to 0 degrees for it to feel like it was around 20 degrees in our room  Great location for seeing the city and going out Les Ramblas though probably a bit far if you re there for the beach Perfect for us in late November though ,1
On arriving in NY after a -- hour flight from Australia I found that our request for a non-smoking room had been ignored and the only room the front desk had left was a smoking room. I could understand this if I had booked the day before but the booking had been made - month previous and guaranteed with my credit card. The room they gave us was so heavily putrid of old cigarette smoke that it was impossible to sleep without fresh air. We had to spend the night with the window open and put up with all the noise. It was obvious that cleaning of carpets and soft furnishing must be nonexistent. Very disappointed about the whole affair and shows very poor management and customer care. Why do I bother with HHilton membership? My complaint has gone unanswered.,0
 The room was small The bed uncomfortable The towels grey A plastic undersheet is a no go The iron and ironing board were poor and had to be requested from reception They couldn t provide a proper hairdryer  They loaned us umbrellas ,0
 Staff training is essential  The staff was rude It put us in such a bad mood The entrance to the garage was broken It made it hard to get in and out of the parking area The garage was filthy The hotel is not at all central It takes over half an hour by tram to get to the sightseeing areas The room itself was nice We had a view of the river,0
 My door was very difficult to close but when I reported the problem The next day they fixed it  The location was very good Near the museums shops and not far to walk to many places Breakfast and Wi Fi was great The staff was very helpful and polite ,1

 The service is not good they where booking us into a club but in the end we where not n the list and ended up with no party at all They handled the service and complain afterwards very poorly The lady from customer service was very unfriendly and unorofeesional I would have fired her in second if it would be my hotel  The hotel is nice and the location is good ,0
"I should start by saying that I only paid $---night and checked into the hotel at midnight and back out - hours later to get to a flight, so it was a brief and inexpensive stay. 
However, the room was just kind of icky - water damage in the ceiling had caused plaster to hang down, the plumbing around the toilet was old and cruddy-looking, the carpet seemed worn, that kind of thing. 
Basically, it was the kind of place where my kids and I didn't want to touch anything more than we had to. It couldn't be any closer to the airport, so that is a huge bonus for a tight schedule.",0
"Its located in the heart of San Francisco on Market Street & surrounded by fascinating shops, restaurants, clubs and attractions.
Complimentary hi-speed wireless internet access, in-room coffee, safe and hairdryer, telephone data port, and cable television. The place serves good and tasty food. The rooms are fairly nice and had a great experience here.",0

"I was one night in Chicago for a reunion that was held at the hotel. The check in was swift. They upgraded my room without me asking. The service, food and drink provided by the hotel for the event were exquisite. The place was clean and the rooms were quiet. There is wi-fi in the hotel which is a plus. After my main event, I wanted to visit Second City. They advised me not to take the train there but to take a cab. It was a short ride and I was dropped off safely in front of the place. It was easy to hail a cab to return to the hotel. Check out was easy and I was on my way in no time.",1
 If you get a room on the ground floor that mean you will have a view on the ground the room was lower then ground Staff was inattentive and unhelpful Not possible to regulate temperature in the room was very stuffy  New hotel and rooms Very clean Location ,0

Small pool but Ok for a quick dip",0
"The location of the hotel is perfect - it's - minutes' walk from the riverside. The rooms are spacious and have everything you need, we had - poster beds. There's an unheated outdoor pool that's about --m by --m. The hotel is slightly dated, e.g. the cover for the fireplace in our room had fallen off and our room could have done with a paint, but apart from that it was fine. The staff did everything we needed of them but were rather grumpy",0

 The room was ridiculously small Basically the size of the small bed and the doorway Smallest I have ever experienced Not even room to put your travel bag down Literally a cupboard  Location and modern fittings Also good cleanliness ,0

 Everithing Nothing,0
"Having just returned from a trip to Boston, staying at the Lenox, I can only add to the excellent reviews I read on TA before booking.
What a lovely hotel, comfortable, good location, but most of all the SERVICE.
From the bell boys to the management, nothing was too much trouble.
A special mention for the receptionists. Always happy and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
A small example: The hotel provides tea & coffee in the lobby in the mornings until about --.--am
I was late one morning, and everything had been cleared away.
The receptionist noticed, and asked if she could help, I said no not to worry I'd just missed the coffee.
She asked me to wait, and returned a moment later with fresh coffee from the restaurant - No charge.
If you want a great stay in Boston - there can be no better experience than at the Lenox.",1

 The only potential uncomfortable thing is the bathroom which is only some sort of capsule with very thin walls and barely isolated and sound proofed So if you travel with someone and you are not at very high intimacy levels using the bathroom may be a bit strange  The hotel is a good buy for the area and for the price You cannot find anything better at that comfort level for what they are charging ,1

"This hotel is a little bit tucked away and not your typical New York hotel wherein you walk -- feet and run into hotels, bars, shops, etc. But it was a great deal for the money and it included breakfast, which is really difficult to find in the city!
The staff was fantastic as well. The rooms were small, which is alright, but the walls were paper thin! We could hear everything in every room and everyone in the hallway, including the housekeeping staff yelling at each other.
Overall we would stay here again because of the very low price in Manhattan, it includes breakfast, the room was clean and the staff is terrific. Oh yeah, NONE of the cab drivers knew where this place is! What happened to the GPS in the taxis?!",0

 The bath plug and other small things were not working When I asked the cleaner he apologised and said everything is old in the hotel unfortunately The price we paid at our time of stay was not what we booked in for through booking and not worth having basic accessories that do not work in the room  The staff were friendly and the bar is good they make a lovely hot chocolate ,0

The concierge has alot of attitude. No one says hello to you when you walk in. My phone in my room was not working. I had to call from my cell to have someone come up to fix the phone. Someone came up at -am was in my room for -- minutes, couldnt fix the phone. The next day I had to actually ask the bouncer(concierge lol) to send someone up to fix the phone. I got ALOT of attitude. The room was dark and very gloomy. The reason I fly to LA is for the sun. This hotel is not worth the price at all. No customer service and lots of attitude.",0

"A comfy, small hotel with a European feel to it. The location is superb, one block off Union Square and a half block to a cable car line. The best thing about the Hotel Rex, though, is the friendly and knowledgable staff, accommodating to the nth degree. ( They recommended Fino Ristorante to us, which was within easy walking distance of the hotel, and Fino turned out to be an excellent choice, rated #- among -,--- restaurants in San Fran.) The rooms were adequate in size and very clean. We experienced no outside noise, since our room did not face Sutter Street. We particularly enjoyed the complimentary wine in the lobby from --- pm. The hotel has an interesting array of art work all over, and the lamp shades in the rooms are hand-painted. All in all, a nifty little hotel with heart.",1

No Negative Friendliness of staff Comfortable bed Easy internet access,1
 At times there was smell and some noise from the streets but then it s the price to pay to be in the old town It wasn t constant and it didn t ruin it I still like the place  Modern spacious cozy feel in the middle of medieval Barcelona Nice terrace at top of building ,1
No Negative Staff hotel ambiance meals rooftop garden restaurant ,1
 after i expand the sofa to change it to bed for kids the room get smaller and hard to walk around the view very poor which was facing the other hotel too much expensive taxi from and to airport around 200 pound tow ways  10 to 12 minutes walking to the attractions london eye big ben there are many bus stops near the hotel,1
 Everything was fab The shower could have been a tad modern but everything was great overall Bed was extra comfy Complimentary upgrade Lovely nights stay ,1
 The hotel felt tired and uninspired Breakfast was only average and chaotic 2 out of the 3 mornings My pillow was horrible my husband s not bad It could all have been so much better with an injection of style and enthusiasm because there is plenty of potential in the building  The location is ideal walking distance from a lot of attractions ,0
 Placing a budget buffet restaurant makes this place a 4 Star You can expect to be underwhelmed from the slow lifts uncomfortable beds poorly furnished to the cafeteria style breakfast TIP if you do stay ask the waiter for a coffee and you will be presented with a great coffee as opposed to the self serve machine On our 3rd day we were asked to move rooms as the one we were in needed repairs to the A C This would have been okay if they had a room to put us in but they asked us to vacate the room while we waited for another room to become available District is a bit derelict surrounded by two skeletons of buildings either side Photos are not representative of rooms  Staff are great overworked and way understaffed,0
 I experienced that the hotel style was in progress as if there were elements of several approaches The breakfast on the patio was lovely the orchids were awesome the staff was fantastic ,1
 Welcome by one of the receptionists  Food atmosphere ,1

"Just wanted to take the time to compliment the Lakefront restaurant at the Hilton on the quality of their breakfast cuisine, especially the freshness and variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as the variety of items on the hot buffet, including the made to order omelet bar which is great. And last but not least, I must compliment the courteous, friendly and efficient service of the server staff especially Fanny. it's always nice when people remember you from previous visits. Her friendly smile and words always makes me feel like I'm a neighbor. The best compliment I can give is my recommendation to my business associates which I continue to do.
Please keep up the good work and the Hilton Lakefront is where I'll go for breakfast!",1
 the room was very small and on the lower ground floor the basement the view was of a wall and some astro turf we asked for 2 singles we actually got what I would describe as a Scandinavian double as there was no room at all between the beds the kettle was tucked in a corner and difficult to use safely there were only 2 tea bags for 2people all day and no biscuits at all and non of the supposedly delicious cookies the hotel advertises the desk dressing table was unusable as there was no room for someone to sit and another to pass behind the young lady on check in was quite blunt and not at all helpful until my daughter berated her  the location only a ten minute walk to the curry Sark and the river boats ,0
 The room service was not what I expect from an expensive and highly rated restaurant They didn t refill coffee pods for example and I think they were overall not as efficient as I expect from a great hotel Front desk staff is very helpful and friendly Location was perfect in relation to cafes in marais love the neighborhood However not too close to metro quite a walk 6 10 minutes or so Far from airport but worth it,0
 No bath just a shower For the price paid this should be obligatory Also no towel rail heated or otherwise No explanation of how to operate the lifts which needed a swipe of your key card before pressing your floor number Took us a few goes to realise We only received one key card but when my husband left the room while I had a rest he had to leave this so I could have power but this meant he couldn t use the lifts and the stair doors were locked He had to go all the way down to the spa and ask them to let him out  Excellent bathroom lighting in a room with no window,1
 Nothing  The relaxing atmosphere in all the hotel which is a relief in a busy city as London Also the friendly staff and their willingness to help the guests is a plus point ,1
 Safe wouldn t open Shower door fell off Shower flooded Shower head kept falling off Shuttle that was suppose to take us to the train station was missing  Was quite cheap,0

 They still have to refund me the amount of 52 accessed from my account despite me paying them in cash I have filed a complaint to my bank due to no answer from Vincci Maritimo regarding my call about this matter  The room was clean ,0
 No view no room service and house keeping after 4 pm No view ,0
 This is NEVER a 5 Star Hotel in any sense and more akin to a medium 4 Star The hotel is old and shabby and dirty Shower was pathetic and the furniture damaged and broken and showing signs of repair Other than the location which is good and close to the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs Elysee I could not recommend it to any traveller  The only redeeming areas of this hotel are the staff who are extremely pleasant and very helpful with lovely professional attitudes and the location ,0
 Bed was uncomfortable Great location and lovely breakfast in the morning,1
 Luggage wouldn t fit into room it was so small bath tub side was hanging off staff were rude and argumentative breakfast was stale  Nothing,0

 Would of had breakfast if buffet style For prices charged think breakfast should be included Lovely clean hotel very pleasant staff comfortable facilities,1
 Location especially if you re walking from the Shadwick DLR in the dark seems a bit dodgy Hotel itself is great and I m guessing that things are safe but the streets were quite dirty  Great room good size Very nice bathroom quite clean There s a great Turkish restaurant Efe s just up the block ,1
 It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room ,1
 Room was supposed to have a view all I could see was a car park  staff were very helpful,0
 Really terrible arrival experience with heavy unfriendly security at the entrance really rude and aggressive I don t mind security for obvious reasons but make it professional also each time you go in and out of the hotel really unprofessional front desk staff  Good location for Paris easy to get to,0
 Room dark no natural light as internal room over looking interior of hotel Room not made up for second night of my stay no towels replaced etc Took a while to get served in bar on second night being ignored staff not aware who should be served next very poor service for this calibre of hotel  Great location nice room Good value for money ,1

No Negative Complimentary coffee and tea,1
"Old Town Inn was clean and conveniently located to all areas of San Diego. I was a little intimidated by the fact that it is across the street from the huge Space and Naval Warfare Command Systems Complex, but managed to sleep peacefully. The new king size pillow top beds were not very comfortable and had cheap plasticky mattress covers on them that shifted and made noises with every turn. The AC fan was loud, but I convinced myself it was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""white noise"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". No fan in the bathroom, so bring a candle. If I had to do it all over again, I would probably choose this Inn for it's convenience, cleanliness and price.",0
No Negative Bar area was tastefully decorated and spacious and the food from the bar in the evening was excellent ,1
 Not a fan of the room charging facility that is in place as it is open to being abused as i discovered someone charged my room with food and drinks but the hotel very quickly investigated and refunded my money  Very friendly and professional staff excellent location with fantastic assess to the public transport system The sky bar is a great place to dine or have a drink but found the reception area bar was cheaper and still a nice environment,1
 room could have been bigger  helpful staff good breakfast ,1
 During my stay the housekeeping did not even clean my room The room does not have any room slipper cotton earbud nor any shaver provided  The bed is very comfortable and the hotel location is situated quite close by the Centraal station about 5 10mins walk ,1

 The offer doesn t satisfy the demand Location,1
 Nil Excellent breakfast Helpful staff Excellent location ,1

 too expensive breakfast little bedrooms and bathrooms no proper ventilation and fresh air in the rooms rooms were very clean and quiet personnel was always available kind shuttle to the airport very useful also to get the train to the city center from airport train station ,0
"Love the view. Love the location. Love the staff. But, I hate just about everything else about this hotel!!
For one thing they charge $-.-- per day for wifi - PER DEVICE!
The thing that irritates me most though is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""go green"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" get - bucks for not having the maid clean your room deal. How blatantly transparent can these corporate idiots be? They must think we customers are morons. 
First, anyone staying at the Seattle Westin has to have enough money that five bucks isn’t going to put him-her in a pinch. Second, maids need to work too. Third, how is not having a hotel pay someone to cleanup your room a “green” issue? 
It’s just plain old corporate greed people. My advice – give the Westin a pass until Starwood pulls their head out … if you know what I mean.

"Club Quarters are practical business hotels, not flash but comfortable and practical. I stayed in a standard room and found that this was the best of the brand I have yet visited. Comfortable , bright , helpful staff and a great work-restaurant on the -th floor. This is a small property and I was in two minds whether to recommend it as I'm worried that I'll struggle to find a room next time I want to visit NY.",1
 They sorted out the room while I was having breakfast I wasn t leaving until 12 00am so couldn t relax in the room until then so had to go downstairs I thought they would wait until the clients had checked out Liked everything else  Bed was sooooo comfortable I felt like I was in a bid puffed up pillowhad an amazingly comfortable inght sleep ,1

 Horrible staff I paid extra for twin room get single bed room dirty toilets No Positive,0
 We booked a suite the tv in the lounge area did not work which meant the lounge area was a waste of money we had to speak to reception on FOUR seperate occasions over 2 days before someone came to the room we were then told the sky didn t work No coffee facilities in the room we were told they were hoping to rectify the situation A four star hotel should not be letting people down on these points would I stop there again they will have to improve  Location was close to 2 of the main rail stations and was picked for that reason The waiters in the resteraunt were excellent and the decor was fantastic,0

 We booked this hotel as the most reasonable with a pool It was a very good standard and the pool was great but overall compared to similar hotels I think it was a bit pricey Location was not ideal but a short walk to metro stations and about 20 minute walk to the beach  The staff were very friendly and courteous they made our stay most enjoyable The service and facilities room and pool area were great Requested a quiet room and slept like a baby no street or guest noice at all ,0
 I have stayed here before and thought rooms were clean bed comfortable perfectly acceptable and reasonable value for London hotel On this occasion I was given a poor room that was sometimes noisy the main problem was the beds Two single beds that were spongy and felt like a camp bed to sleep on shower head also would not adjust Hopefully this was a one off No Positive,0

 The cost of the KIT KAT from the mini bar  The size cleanliness and quality of fittings with respect to the room The comfort of the bed The provision of tea and coffee in the room The location of the hotel ,1
 Bar staff had an attitude problem He was doing us the favour not the other way round No help with luggage on arrival or leaving  Front Desk staff efficient and friendly Car Park expensive at UKP 24 day but this is probably average for London Lovely room overlooking Hyde Park,1
 Air con wasn t very effective Clean bright and comfortable,1
 Location although central isn t in the nicest location Clean spacious rooms good value for money,1
"My mom, sister, and I came to San Diego for my sister's --th birthday. I chose the Pacific Terrace specifically because of positive user reviews. We were not disappointed! The hotel was beautiful and everyone was helpful and friendly. Our room was upgraded at check-in, and the view we had from our balcony was unbelievable. We all loved the robes and slippers that were provided. The bathroom was exceptionally large and it was very easy for the - of us to get ready in the mornings. We asked for a taxi and we were provided with a driver that worked for the hotel. Carlos made our trip even more enjoyable and gave us first rate service with a smile! The Pacific Terrace is a very special place. We all plan to come back again.",1
 I was made to wait for 3 hours in reception for the police this was terrible as it was late at night I had been working all day I wasn t offered a drink I was frightened as I was a woman alone no security didn t sleep well  When I arrived at the room there was a naked man in my room I went to reception they retrieved the man who was a homeless man who had somehow managed to gain access ,0
"I stayed here in Nov. ---- and left my vehicle for - days. The people here are amazing at customer service, being helpful and friendly. They went way out of their way to be helpful. Dina and Khit at the front desk are great. thanks to Daryl, the shuttle driver for being extremely helpful and James is a good shuttle driver as well. I have stayed at three park and fly hotels in Seattle and this was by far the best. I thought the price was very reasonable as well.",1
 rooms too small the staff are nice,0
 Upgrade suite was small bathroom exceptionally tiny  The staff were marvellous made us feel at home Quality was excellent ,1

 Inconsistent guest information from staff Check out was disappointing and unfriendly We checked out at 6 45 the young man who we think worked night shift and was cleaning reception was very offhand I think 800 Euro for two night deserved at least did you enjoy your stay and have a safe flight or look forward to welcoming you back  Location bed comfort L Occitane products in bathroom Complimentary bubbly wine on New Years Eve All day free tea coffee and hot chocolate and snacks 24 hour Bar Resturants and bars and shops and city highlights all within a few minutes walking distance,1

 Ask to have a late checkout as we had a international flight out in the evening Was initially told this would be fine The next day we confirmed and were then told this was not possible and offered no other solutions by the staff We were not happy and ended up having to book an additional hotel  Close to train station and fairly modern ,0
No Negative Close to metro Car park Don t take a big car as it won t fit ,0
 Its a bit run down  Location is too good Rooms are reasonably spacious Lots of eateries around,1
 Both the interior and exterior design are terrible This place should hire an architect to improve it The bed was pretty hard Breakfast was nice but as there were a lot of guests eating at the same time it was complicated to find the table They ran out of some meals every 20 minutes Coffee from the machine was pretty bad The food quality in the restaurant was very poor and overpriced  This hotel is situated in a good position towards Expo and RHO Fierra perfect for travelers with car Rooms were clean service was nice Parking was FREE ,1
 room service is the worst dose not clean well when he finished cleaning my room I didn t find my 3 lemons Also I figured out someone open my pockets There is bad smell was coming out of our bathroom The arrangements of the room is not suitable that makes the room bigger enough breakfast is excellent Nora is the best waiter working hard restaurant at the 8th floor wonderful train station is very near 5 minutes walk,0

 Air conditioning in the rooms is urgently needed It was much to hot in the room  The location was perfect ,0
Good location for my business travel. Easy to access anywhere in city with Grab taxi. Also convenient shopping mall downstairs to buy groceries or go eat in many different restaurants. Wifi was good. Cleaning service was a nice addition. Beds were comfy compared to earlier apartments I have stayed in. Only thing missing was a water boiler for hot coffee in the morning and the kitchenware selection was somewhat limited to rice cups and couple of spoons. This is a top choice for my next visits.,1
"My husband & I stayed here at the beginning of March & found it to be a very nice hotel. It was just a short distance away from Central Park & Times Square.

"There are much better hotels. After traveling down from Boston we got into NYC at -(room was to be available at -), exhausted, my fiance and I arrived at the hotel, awaiting a quick nap, instead, we were treated horribly; had to wait for hours(offered us a drink from the bar but neither of us drink)for our reserved room(I noticed three other couples waiting too!), but then never got it!--We were put on a smoking floor and I have bad allergies--and our room wasn't discounted at all for this. They explained it as the people extended their stay--this means that our reserved room is taken and we'd have to wait around for the next available room whenever that would be! This was supposed to be a romantic valentines day weekend and they made it nearly unbearable for us.",0

No Negative Very quiet and clean ,1
 We had a generator outside our room which started around 7am on the first day and then when we took the first shower the shower tray flooded and we had to move room Nobody should have been put in this room due to the generator being right outside the window but they obviously chance their luck here as there is no way this has not been complained about before The property is also a 20 min walk from the nearest tube station and there are no bars or restaurants around I am not sure what constitutes a 4 star but I would not say this hotel is any better than any 3 star I have stayed in  It was very modern in the rooms ,0

 A bit noisy outside at times  Fantastic Hotel in a great location for theatres restaurants and the underground Had a free upgrade the bed was very comfortable bathroom a bit small but well equipped Complimentary Coffee tea biscuits water and fresh fruit Freindly helpful staff ,1
 The hotel is over priced It needs to remember that part of its function is as a railway hotel and price accordingly for in transit customers Perhaps separate off the corporate business side from the travellers All restaurants were very noisy Bad acoustics one of the restaurants is vault like and with wooden floors the din was unbearable The WiFi rate is very expensive 7 per 24hrs standard rate 15 per 24hrs for high speed broadband Surely WiFi charging my stay at the rack rate should be free  The location Had to catch early morning Eurostar so this hotel is ideally situated Beautiful building well renovated ,1

 Staff where unfriendly and didn t explain anything too me My room was 109 but I had to pay 159 when I got there as a security deposit for the room which I wasn t aware of until I got there Then when leaving they took 109 for the actual stay and told me the money would go back in from before as that wasn t actually took off my card just frozen Bottom line I still don t have that money back 7 days later And my bank have had to put a dispute in to get my money back When I called them they said my bank must be lying or you must have an account abroad I live in England and my bank account is in England and really doubt they are lying to me terrible customer service No Positive,0

No Negative Hotel staff is very nice atmosphere is relaxed and rooms are modern comfortable Locations is great for exploring London Walking distance to soho and multiple underground stations ,1
 at weekends it can get noisy at night with students gathering and drinking in the street mixed experience with the staff ordering a taxi for instance proved sometimes impossible then on departure I had left something valuable behind which was not returned to me so I cannot recommend it to anyone The location is central not far from Kings X it is not a hotel but college accomodation so more intimate if you like that,0
 You can hear the noise of people entering and exiting other rooms and their conversations the morning cleanibg service starting at 8 Our room had a small shower  Big confortable room nice modern furniture lighting and decoration Very well located 2 minutes away from shopping and the metro line that connects with the city centre and the train for the airport We will come back ,1
 Cleaning service in the room was limited instances of rubbish not being collected from the room Dressing gowns were taken from the room after one wear and not replaced Breakfast fine but a little uninspired  Beds comfortable and great location ,0

"We arrived one night after -- hours of traveling to find that the hotel had given our confirmed reservation away! We had booked this hotel back in May, confirmed before our travel, and even PAID for it before we arrived, only to be told they were """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""overbooked"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and had to give our reservation away. Apparently having a confirmed reservation means nothing. They put us up in a dirty, nasty hotel called the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Renton Inn"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" that was literally between a pawn shop and a massage parlor, and miles away from where we needed to be. They were going to offer us another free night at a Radisson, but we said no thank you! They still have not credited us our charge card, so we are still arguing with the credit card company about that.
Don't bother staying here -- even with a reservation -- it will not guarantee anything.",0
 Staff at reception was not friendly They just did not care Did not make us feel welcome They were always talking with each other Rooms were dusty Bathtub was not clean  Location,0

 Everything else Wi fi sucks They took me to the adjacent Mercure First where the internet speed was far better Nobody is bothered about your breakfast Crowd management during rush hour really bad Staff just go through their motion Rooms are really TINY I stumbled on my suitcase multiple times Staff at the reception are least bothered about your stay never enquired about our experience while checking out Steer clear of this hotel Period  Location ,0
 Sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door I slept on sofa bed not very comfortable,0

 Matchbox sized room next to lift Coat hangers no wardrobe No mirror for hair dryer Very small bathroom with no space for toilet bag Socket with intermittent fault TV unable to change channel or turn off unless we disabled the power to the room The staff allowed us to extend checking out to 12 noon,0
 If staying at the front as we did the main road noise can be heard throughout the night and construction site opposite started early however this is part and parcel of the location of the hotel and can not be helped Parking very difficult and definitely first come Lovely hotel and rooms very modern and well presented,1
 The room was warm There was no air conditioning that functioned Could not leave the window open all night because of the noise from the street Wasn t enough of an issue that we needed to contact the hotel staff  The staff and hotel were excellent Very friendly and helpful The facilities appeared clean and the bathroom was clean ,1

 the staff was not helpful and a bit rude to us when were trying yo head to the spa The breakfast was a disaster and they were unprepared due to a large number of guests It was suppose to be a relaxing weekend for us but it ended up disappointing  the location is nice,0
 We paid for bed and breakfast and ended up not getting any breakfast because apparently we didn t pay for breakfast when we have proof we did And they charged us city tax at the end of the stay that we wasn t made aware of at the beginning of our stay when we had spent all our money already It was around 7 per night on top of what you have already paid Also be aware that when you get in they ask for a 50 deposit just incase you use the minibar They give it back to you at the end of your stay but it s such a faff  The bed was very comfortable ,0

 No milk in the room and no complimentary water in the room The hostess Samantha was amazing I was stressed when I arrived over cost and rooms etc but she was a lovely person to me and just sorted everything out,1
 On the way back from the Metro to the hotel it s quite steep to get back to the hotel so wouldn t recommend for someone who s physical condition is not that great But you could always get a taxi from the city centre to the hotel for about 15  The property had a really good location not too far from the Metro line to the city centre L3 and connection to the airport L9 the walk to the metro was really nice through the park The swimming pool was nice and quite breakfast was really nice not too expensive and enough of everything and good variety Staff was extremely friendly ,1

 HOTEL NEEDS RENOVATION ESPECIALLY THE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS LOCATION,0
"Recently stayed here for five nights. Found the Hilton very adequate, but not spectacular. Skipped the $--.-- breakfast buffet for the $-.-- Grand Slam at Denny's just down the road. Room was average sized but skimpy on drawers for clothes with just three. Room thermostat seemed to be --- degrees off. Water pressure in shower seemed to come and go in cycles and bathroom could use a fan.. Did like the Evelyn & Crabtree toiletries and thick towels. Bell staff-parking valets were very friendly and helpful. Location is good for various San Diego activites. I guess I expect Hiltons to be exceptional properties. This one seems to lack character and would be easily forgotten by most travelers. This was my first Hilton stay in some time and I think in the future I'll stick with a DoubleTree, where you get a bigger bang for your buck.",0

"Right off I--, it was a perfect place to stay. But the rooms weren't that clean, the bathtub was clogged, it smelled like smoke, and the breakfast was non-existent. The cleaning staff was very pushy and waited for us at the door before checkout. And it was very apparent he wasn't cleaning.",0

 The buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet I ve ever had Plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology Sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease Such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel  Room was small but comfortable clean and good value for money Reception staff were good other staff seemed fairly disengaged Hotel is historic and architecturally interesting ,0

 Would have liked to have been prompted before arriving regarding the lovely pool on 52nd as we didn t bring swimming things  The bathroom was very special and waking up with the sunrise ,1
Dropped by lounge to check out hotel. Sat at bar to have a glass of wine. Menus were wrinkled. Bartender left snacks from previous guest in front of us. Never checked back with us. When presented check bartender scribbled on our check to see if pen worked. I understand that its a nice place with high end pricing. But back it up with the details,0

The owners and Rudy are very friendly, they helped us a lot finding places to visit and to buy everything we needed. It's a very calm place. No problems to sleep. If I go back to San Antonio, I will stay there again.",1
 Location and building Room was ok bath shower difficult to use as you have to step into a high bath Mini bar broken and car parking ridiculous at 50 a night and they charge for the Internet They ll be charging for water and electricity next ,0
 Breakfast could have been better Excellent location for going to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace ,0
 Breakfast spread could have been better  Bed was comfortable The entire hotel was clean They switched our rooms without any additional fees Centrally located to all the main sites Quiet property even over weekends even though it s in the middle of town We loved it ,1
 Pre booked twin room was unavailable We were forced to take double bed with camp bed AND pay extra 40 per night I have rheumatoid arthritis and my daughter was heavily pregnant I was furious  Good breakfast heated towel rails lounge bar has good ambience ,0
 No breakfast included with booking made online We paid for our breakfast but I think there should have been a bigger selection for the buffet considering the price paid I felt our junior suite was a bit too cozy as I was expecting a more spacious room The Baudelaire did not live up to our expectations but possibly because there was a large function at the hotel so our food was compromised The staff also looked very busy  The location of this small hotel is prime situated in the heart of Paris nearby high end boutiques and famous sites The staff at the front desk were helpful at all times and the premises were clean I appreciated the late check out as I had requested for it ,1
 A small swimming pool would have been nice and we didn t know about USB charging docks till we leaving so they were not obvious  Location right behind the parliament building size of room very large compared to others we ve stayed in huge shower was excellent Staff were very helpful extra pillows arrived immediately even booked our tickets for river trip to our next stop in Bratislava We were also lucky film festival was on at city hall so free externtaient on days we were there with mutilpe kinds of national food on sale ,1
 The spa was closed on the day of our stay and when we said the staff could have let us know were told that it s just one of those things and we couldn t expect it to be open even though this was part of why we booked The room had some wear and year and let down by small things such as no milk for coffee and some our toiletries being throw out by housekeeping The reception staff were not very helpful  The hotel has a great location and very comfortable beds in the room The outdoor terrace was nice although smaller than it appears in the photos Some friendly and helpful staff ,0
 Finding yourself in a room with one window that overlooks the indoor swimming pool where a large number of children are understandably playing noisily and where there is no mobile phone signal is not what I expect for a business booking Then to be advised that there are no alternative rooms but later a different view is given to booking com and I am accused of requesting an upgrade that i had never asked for And when seeking to cancel and get a refund that was refused That wasn t a great experience  Eventually the team on reception were very helpful in dealing with my issue,0

"Great location in downtown Seattle and the people who work there are very nice. Just a couple of things that were disappointing. The towels are thin & rough to the touch which may have added to the problem caused by the complimentary toiletries, we both broke out in red splotches! Problem solved when we went to the store and bought some good stuff. The highlights were a nice bartender and watching the kids in costume from Sakura-Con.",0
 the d cor and bedroom furniture was very tired looking could do with a revamp breakfast was plentiful however was over priced for the lack of quality the location of hotel for means of my trip was very good staff friendly,0

 I lost some small jewelry that you ve developed since I arrived in a bag in the closet until my hotel By many of the make up and other purposes words of shaved permission from the diamonds is very small in size Has been tampered with and a good inspection between content cleaning is not good And the smell of bad towels cleaning crew dishonest Amutiro more breakfast is never varied ,0

 Double queen bed too small Very friendly welcoming staff,1
 Small room different what it was in the website Bathroom was not very well clean  friendly staff and good location ,0
 There was no view and the room therefore felt a bit claustrophobic The only window opened out into an internal well adding to the clautrophobia There were no little touches that personalised the room so felt rather like a bed factory One tea bag each was left by kettle which felt a bit mean  Location is superb just off Trafalgar Square Useful little supermarket on the corner for groceries Staff very helpful and kept bags safe for us before check in and after Room clean Smart TV with internet access Air conditioning available just a little noisy ,1
 No complaints whatsoever  Located very close to metro tram buses the hotel is well worth a stay a newly built modern facility with well designed rooms and a great breakfast We opted for the junior suite which includes free access to the executive lounge The staff is simply great and the hotel restaurant is worth a visit We will definitely be back ,1
 Cleanliness amenities food service The view and location,0
 Client service of this hotel is very poor Staff not friendly absolutely not client oriented bathtub in room had several damages due presumably to shower appliance strikes on it Room was very small as it was for 3 it had a sofa bed we never asked for that So we had real small beds and little space for circulation There are no Do not Disturb tags available for guests elevators are really slow and quite a lot of waiting needed There is a sign at the elevators where the hotel suggests that you should make reservations directly with them in order to have a better price  Location is very good as well as breakfast service ,0
 Darkish fairly small room Hadn t prepared sofa bed for child had to request Bit soulless Not really for families looking to base themselves mostly in their hotel Hard to get info on basics like when meals were where pools were etc Rooftop pool deep would not be suitable for little kids Good for transit excellent for Nou Camp imagine less so for extended young family stay  Perfect for Nou Camp 10 min walk to stadium could see it from the hotel Great rooftop pool really lovely best thing about hotel Friendly staff Good breakfast Nice local neighbourhood area Close to Metro easy access to city centre Very clean and everything worked in room Supplied toiletries hair dryer fridge and safe in room ,0
 No breakfast for the price Offed a discound at the register for breakfast at 20E per person They keep a 70E extra deposit I didnt know that just in case something is happen to the room They will return the amount after you leave Also I had to pay an extra 19E for city taxes Also didnt know never happend to me on other Amsterdam Hotels I thought the price I payed in bookings com was final Not the case here NO wifi in the room and if you open mini bar more than 30sec you might charge There is a warning for that  The location nice room,0

 Rooms are a bit small  Very neat and comfy Centrally located too ,1
 The hotel says they have a gym which is clearly a lie as 4 exercise bikes infront of a TV doesn t consist of a gym was very disappointed with this As it is very hot in Barcelona not having ice buckets to provide ice for guest is ridiculous and then running out of ice on top of that is unheard of The rooftop pool is merely a paddling pool for kids that s all an adult can hardly swim in there Rooms are very dark The beds are the best thing about this hotel not to sure about the leather pillows though,0
 The staff are polite and welcoming its a pity the hotel didn t live up to the standards portrayed The room was cold the bathroom cramped The wall paper was badly marked there were no plug sockets near the mirror which meant I had to find another way to make sure my hair was OK I would have been better off in a B B or Travel Lodge It was central I stayed here as the conference I was going to was held here The staff were polite and welcoming,0
 Frayed carpets in the hallway 60 s wallpaper Grants whiskey bottle left in the corridor Chipped tables in the room with missing handles Temperature advisories on the taps missing Shower holster falling off the wall Double bed in what was told to be a twin room Window we couldn t close considering there was an air vent outlet directly outside our window Air conditioning unit that did not work past setting 1 Location,0

"Seriously they are VERY dog friendly, I stayed here before on the -nd floor, I like the interior corridors. This last time I came with - other co-workers. Granted the front desk warned me I might not want to stay due to animal allergies, but since I had made the reservation and the other - people were okay with staying I figured I could just take an allergy pill. The room I stayed in (#---) smelled like there had been - sweating-drooling saint bernards in it.",0
 My single room was tiny yet only slightly cheaper than a roomier double room The dining breakfast room and bar was cold windowless lacked comfortable sitting possibilities and tablecloths and was in all the total opposite of cosy and comfortable I wouldn t dine or go for an evening drink there for the love of God  The Wesley is very conveniently located within walking distance from St Pancras King s Cross Station and around the corner of Euston Station The room has all the facilities one could wish for and a very comfortable shower Breakfast choices are excellent ,0
 Design of the Hotel Rooms Very dated not tastefully renovated Bathrooms are ridiculous small Overall very bad lighting furniture and interior is very weak Stains on the carpet Breakfast in the morning was crowded felt like a typical tourist hotel with standard food Quality is okay Very Disappointed There are way better Hotels in central London for the same price Never stay there again  Location is very good room size okay Checkin Checkout friendly ,0

 The noise of the trains was very noisy which affected my sleep And also the 100 deposit that I was not informed about I had to take 100 out of My spending money which for one night I could not eat out because I had not enough money for me and my partner  The staff was lovely very kind and helpful ,0

"I took my mother on a little getaway and was very discouraged by our time spent here. The room was not clean, toilet tissue holder sitting on the counter, caulking crumbling in bathroom, dust everywhere. Alarm clock did not work, nor did the coffee maker. Ice machine broke on the -nd day. All complaints were made to housekeeping and front desk. $-- per day, plus tax, to valet park, which is outside and in the elements. The lobby and garden is beautiful and well appointed, but the rest of the hotel is much in need of some TLC. The surrounding community offers much to explore, but I would never stay here again!",0

"I stayed at this hotel this past -th of July and it was simply awesome! The room was extremely clean and spacious. There was a huge flat screen TV and a full size desk-work station. The view from our room overlooked the city. The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was really good, especially the water pressure. The Hotel staff were very nice and very helpful when we needed to rent a -- passenger van to take us where we needed to go. The location is great for shopping, you can just walk up and down the streets and find a lot of good shops. There was one ice cream place that I can't remember the name of but it was probably some of the best ice cream I have ever had.",1
 Our bath was disgusting It had horrible brown orangey stains I wouldn t step in it without having a towel down in the bath There was alot of dust on day of arrival I hated the duck feathered pillows and duvet I would of preferred a mini fridge rather than a mini bar The rooms could do with being updated to match the reception area  We liked how nice it looked in reception And we did order abit of food which was pretty nice It was really close to where we needed to be which made it easier for us ,0
 WiFi should be free of charge Nice and big spacious rooms and bathroom,1
 The first night I could not sleep because of the aircon ventilation It was very loud and could not be switched off I was totally exhausted the whole day not ideal when on business trip On the second day I got another room which was quieter The windows don t isolate from the street noise The deco carpet in the room doors of the elevator etc are old fashioned 80ies It would need a complete renovation I paid 430 for 2 nights incl breaktfast The quality is not worth the price  Staff was kind and helpful ,0

 Not enough tea bags but lots of coffee Nice room breakfast lovely,1
 The reception was very unpolite and rude The lady treatet me like a little child just because i am young I am working in switzerland in a bigger hotel and if i treat a guest like this i wont work anymore there  The badroom was very clean but the roof was wett,0
 there is no refrigerator in the room 504 Safe box does not work bath room floor is the all time wet could be leak under closet elevetor very old not clean and very narrow I don t understand this hotel four star location near the congress center and metro station next the hotel ferdinand on the corner near the hotel restorant would be very pleased ,0
 Could not use the requested bath as tap faulty and water only tepid This was most disappointing as I had suffered a fall the previous week and was looking forward to a soak This apparently was not the first time there had been a problem with the taps in this Room so I really do think staff should have checked the water was running hot when they prepared it  The prompt response from staff maintenance and their attempts to rectify the hot or rather lack of water problem When they could not solve it they offered a drink at the bar or free breakfast but we declined as had already had sufficient and plans for next day too with friends elsewhere,1
 The room was very small and the bathroom tiny No Bedside tables or drawers etc Not value of 230 per night Room very dusty and in need of a full clean  Bed was very comfy,0

 The room was a little small but perfectly adequate the bed was a little hard  The staff were amazingly helpful and friendly We loved the welcome glass of proscecco too ,1
 Maybe room was a little smaller than we thought it would be but we were fine with that plus there was no door between bathroom and living room so when someone woke up earlier he would always make a lot of noise  The location was quite good for us and we enjoyed walking to the center of Barcelona about 15 20 mins Stuff was very friendly and we liked the design of hotel a lot ,1

 The property was dated room was extremely small Adequate but for the rate paid not a good value Many of the guests met were finishing Cruises and I suspect the rate paid was much lower than the rate on booking Room was not available on arrival and it was apparent that was a result of at least one cruise arriving at the same time One of two rooms was upgraded but alas it would seem the party that guaranteed the reservation would have gotten an upgrade reception desk was indifferent to request for an upgrade for the second room booked  Location was very good for a leisure trip to Londons tourist areas and fast access to metro,0
 Too expensive for the quality and comfort not different to premier Inn rather go to premier Inn instead Location wise but lack of car parking,0
 Hotel facilities maintenance Main lift was not working My beds were not commutable you can feel mattress metal spring Informed the hotel management but no action was taken The location is the best You can reach most of key spots by walking ,0
 location is far from public transport at night there is nobody from the nearest bus stop and you have to walk in the middle of nowhere to get the hotel  the bed is very comfortable the breakfast is nice apart from the location everything is fine I find this hotel a bit expensive ,0
 Small showerbox Poor air conditioning Sealed windows Old furniture and carpets Missy swimming pool and gym Spacious rooms compared to other London hotles,0
 Room was extremely noisy until about 4am from the Ramblas every night not well insulated for noise  Clean room comfortable bed Central location for sightseeing Front desk was very helpful,1
 Bath towels need to be much much bigger Perfectly acceptable for an overnight stay for work Yes it does need updating but it doesn t matter for me Stayed here quite a few times ,1
 Bed Bed is dirty I told the staff but she did not care ,0
 You could not move in the bedrooms let alone put your makeup on or do your hair You could not lie down in the bath cracked tiles in the bathroom card for lights fell off the wall You could not move in the breakfast room  The food was very good,0
 Cleanliness We received what seemed to be used towels with various strands of hair on them We notified the reception the issue was fixed but there was no actual apology for this situation Looking at the room price this situation was rather unpleasant and unexpected as having clean towels is a basic commodity of every hotel Room Centralized heating system not working as configured sometimes heat was delivered but we were cold on multiple occasions  Location Hotel is easily accessible from airport 15 min on foot from Lelylaan train station The Tram Line 2 Delflandlaan station is right in front which goes to Central Station Room Modern look functional espresso machine in room was nice to have ,0
 Room was very warm Bed very comfy ,1
 the front desk at night is empty the staff setting at guest area at check in they gave me wrong room when I entered I found a sleepy man old furniture not clean well old carpet old and bad elevator  Nothing at all,0
 Double charge and check of credit card and this results a block on more amount on credit card You should charge the full amount as agreed at the first night and NOT make trials if credit card is working through blocking amount and release immediately cause release will appear only after 2 weeks which is very very bad  Location,0
 Room was noisy and cold I stayed 4th 5th January 2016 I had to sleep in my fleece to stay warm despite using the one spare blanket provided  Convenient near the station Barcelona Sants from which I was travelling,0
 Nothing I liked this hotel so much I went back 3 weeks later The only thing that would be a nice to have is somewhere for everyone to have breakfast as opposed to in their rooms but I understand the hotel building isn t that big Still though 10 10 for me  Fantastic hotel room that s in an excellent location and 2min walk from the Duomo Staff are also very friendly and helpful and go the extra mile for any request My suitcase was lost on the flight in from Milan and Deborah from hotel reception continually chased lost baggage services for me until it was found Excellent allround ,1

 More milk portions Clean and well situated,1
 Bathroom was a joke Light over sink was very poor Sink too high REALLY frosted glass for bathroom wall and not one hook in bathroom to hang tolietries Rugs in hallway and bedroom desperately needed to be replaced Dirty and stained  Comfortable bed,0
"It was very disappointing experience. We had expected better being an SPG member. When we walked into the room, it smelled like smoky bar. We'll can't really fault the hotel but instead of offering us a room, they offered to ionize for about -- minutes. Having a child with us, we insisted on a different room. There was some confusion with the bellman and the front desk, and when the bellman came he was very unpleasant. He ragged about it and was in a hurry, and barked out directions to us to follow. We took a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nice"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tour of the back of house and frieght elevators. We did not feel like guests. We went to the Java bar and our server was not very happy also, does anyone smile at this hotel? We are really sorry to have bothered these people on our vacation.",0
 the room is not sizable for a family but more for a couple or single traveller the glasses door for the shower room can t be closed tightly so water actually flooded out and makes the place a bit messy everyday Good location within 10 mins walk to kalsplatz metro station and 20 mins to Stephen Church Quiet place at night Service crew are nice and ready to help the hotel is very generous to offer free mini bar drinks and wines everyday,1
 They charged us with city taxes which was already included in our booking and paid They also charged us for extra 20 in addition to the price asked by our reservation at the time of booking 3 weeks before the reservation No place to park your car and unload your luggage to hotel  It was clean A metro station 13 is in front of the hotel ,0

The Strand is a good hotel for a reasonable price. Rooms are nice although a bit small. The breakfast is average. Not a lot of choice.,0
 I prepaid but found that AUD 88 has been charged twice to my credit card No Positive,0
"My mother and I stayed at this hotel before and after a cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Micheal L. even went above and beyond by assisting us with our luggage to our rooms. The rooms and beds were comfortable. The rooms included a wet bar with fridge and microwave. The location is in short walking distance to the Space Needle. They can arrange transportation to-from the pier for a cruise or to-from the airport. For a local (dive) diner that is open --hrs with good food, ask for walking directions to the Hurricane. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1
 The room was extremely small and cold it was recomended by the hotel on the booking as ideal room for families 2 adults and a child Poor staff quality at the spa Very disappointed No Positive,0
 not clear re parking sense of space,1

 I didn t like everything rooms were extremely dirty we found some blood in our bed cover A lot of dirty stuff in the ground They don t give a slipper no complementary water This hotel is trash I would rather pay 100 pound more to live in a better place is much more worth it Location But everything else was bad so a good location is not worth it ,0
No Negative Very nice and gentle staf good rooms and good service ,1
 We stayed for 3 nights the first was without a mattress then asked the following morning for a mattress topper which i felt was more polite Definitely a waste of money and we felt it was a waste We have previously visited fairmount in canada and are aware of there normal high standards I don t normally review hotels as a rule but felt i had to on this occasion staff where able to provide the basic amenities when asked but as a regular traveller these were very basic such as a mattress for the bed kettle and cups with sachets of tea and coffee also required an iron which was not steam and we were quite shocked as we thought with building work ongoing they would have pulled the stops on the contrary it was the opposite ,0
 Toalit not very clean The furniture is very old very very small elivator and sometimes not working  The hotel is in a good location there is a privet parking ,0
 Unhelpful rude staff Booked a room for three people and only one bottle of water and 2 tea bags Despite repeatedly asking it took a few calls and lots of waiting for the extra to arrive Monday nights room service did not turn up at all  Nothing,0

No Negative Staff were great good location and quite Good clean room comfy bed ,1
 Lured in by the images of the roof top bar but far too crowded to actually enjoy that Had I known that I would not be able to get a decent seat at that bar then I would have chosen somewhere else to stay as there are better places for the money IMO Sadly that is the lasting memory I will take away from the experience No Positive,0
 everything is good Great location stylish decoration with nice scenery warm stuffs,1

No Negative The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and took an interest in our stay ,1
 Hotel was grubby throughout especially the walls and bathroom in our room One complimentary tea bag for two of us wifi exceptionally slow and the food buffet was disappointing When I called reception for Assistance I was told to call back later as they were busy No Positive,0
 The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult  The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,1
 Understaffed at breakfast bacon not renewed but it was boxing day  Spacious modern public areas Good sized room for London well designed shower room bed v comfortable Excellent lift system A class act for the price in London Handy for Westfield and close to tube and buses for central London ,1

No Negative staff,1
 no wifi in the room  large sized room,0
No Negative Great Location,1
 Overall Crowne Plaza Milan City was a nice hotel and met my needs for a quick weekend getaway to Milan However there is a bar club nearby which has an outside patio which was quite loud on a Saturday night even with the windows closed you could still hear the noise Also the fitness center was very small and had limited options not a huge deal as the weather was nice outside but maybe not as suitable for a traveller looking to utilize the space a bit more  Great location literally steps from the subway system ,1
 Free WiFi is terrible There was a long line to check out this process should be a lot faster  Stayed here many times now and the location is unbeatable Right next to Rembrandt square but because of double glazed windows and tick curtains still relatively quiet at night Rooms are of fresh design comfi mattress and spacious enough to sit as well ,1
 I stayed earlier this year Jan 17 and was delighted with the room I stayed in Hence I made a return visit However on this ocassion I was very disappointed with condition of the room Clearly the hotel is in the process of renovation The building works did not disrupt my stay However the rate I paid for the poor condition of the room was not value for money  The service from the hotel staff was excellent The reception staff were most helpful with all my requests They generously gave me an adaptor for the duration of my stay and assisted with other requests The housekeeping service did a lovely job cleaning the room despite the poor condition of the room ,0
 Doesn t look quite like the photos Breakfast very small probably not worth the money better going to a cafe elsewhere  Bed was really comfy location was good ,0
 Bad noise isolation should consider higher floors if travelling with children  Good location 5 minutes walking to Paddington station ,0

 Poor sound isolation good sevice all very clean The breackfast is good,1
 My room was expensive at 216 night but given the hotel is supposedly a 4 I thought it seemed reasonable However even though I was upgraded to a suite room the hotel was dirty decoration tired the angle of the TV in my bedroom meant I couldn t watch it the maid knocked multiple times before I checked out when I wasn t ready with no do not disturb sign available This hotel it not 4 quality At least decorate re carpet and keep them clean Really a renovation is needed here it s not worth the price I paid by a long way  Location is near Hyde Park wifi good ,0

 Rooms and beds smaller than most wardrobes Noisy extraction vents so close to the window you couldn t even open it room 111 Changed room for the second night room 206 and was just the same For around 150 per night I would expect to be able to walk around the bed Not even enough space to open a case and get changed Thoroughly disappointed and would advise everyone to book elsewhere Plenty of other roomy hotels in the same location for less money  Location,0
 Tiny elevator Good breakfast Lovely room with balcony Excellent staff service ,1
No Negative The location of the hotel is great You have a metro station very close but who likes a good walk and go up to the tower or to the Luxembourg garden There are also some restaurants around shops and supermarkets It is already the 3rd time we stay here and we like a lot The view from the bar upstairs is great ,1
 Not much to dislike Rooms were great Staff were really helpfull Great breakfast,1

 I was having a very different opinion about Sofitel but this one was not even close to that Most of the experiences were negative a Restaurant staff were very rude and they do not know how to treat the customers b Breakfast options not good very limited and routine c Not much option for Lunch and Dinner d In house restaurant didn t even had veggies for preparing a Salad for a dinner e At 10 30 nothing except a soup was available for dinner in an in house restaurant then hows it a 24 hour restaurant f Doorman staff were not that friendly  Hmm good question but to be honest it didn t meet my expectation Room service and house keeping was bit ok ,0

 The rooms were far too small for us The first room we were shown didn t even have a window The second room did but that let in noise from outside which went on well into the early hours of the morning The only respite from the noise were earplugs left by the hotel  Helpful staff and hotel in a great location for theaters and restaurants Everywhere seemed nice and clean ,0
 Due to some internal problems in pansion organization only 2 out of 3 beds prepared on arrival late in the evening after 10 PM and no reasonable solution offered for the problem by the staff before our insisting to call the manager Rooms not heated in advance and therefore not warm enough In the morning owner of the place was angry because we asked him to be called late in night After explanation he turn in anger to his staff and offered as a reimbursement 20 discount  Comfortable beds good selection of food for breakfast walking distance from main attractions ,0
No Negative Hotel very close to train station but very quiet enjoy it,1

 I specifically booked a twin room since it was a business trip but upon check in I was advised all twin rooms were booked out and would a double be ok and I advised that I booked a twin room They put a spare pull out bed in the room which was like a camping bed Very uncomfortable and not what I had paid for so extremelly disappointing and feel mislead Would expect a refund based on the fact I was not provided with the room advertised and paid for  Friendly and great staff Great location Great breakfast ,0
 Value for money Everything overpriced  Staff were great helpful and friendly ,0
 the corridors were extremely narrow and the lift very small One of us took stairs while the other had the case in the lift each time  Layout of room was lovely separate room with tv and couch Breakfast was lovely food gorgeous ,0
 Things I did not like is the hotel do not have health club or Sauna Staff are very friendly even the cleaners are very friendly ,1
"The lobby was wonderfully quiet and classy---much nicer than the hyper-noisy atmosphere at most larger commercial establishments. The front desk and other staff were uniformly friendly, professional and helpful. My wife and I stayed in a very reasonably priced large one bedroom suite, complete with kitchen and two televisions. We entertained friends for breakfast (Starbucks and other coffee shops are nearby), and they couldn't believe the size and comfort level of the suite. All in all, a great place to relax and unwind, while visiting NYC.",1
 The room was so cold I thought I would slip into a coma Luckily the duvet was OK The hot water seemed to run out in the evening luke warm showers are not my thing No Positive,0

"We chose to stay in Azul Inn in August .. we though it was the perfect spot to be in since beverly hills and santa monica are very closed... The room was not bad ... the only complain i have is....DO NOT LEAVE ANY shoes or any belongings because you will feel sorry just like we felt when we realize our things were missing ..
We didn't realize things were missing because we woke up a bit late and we had to check out so we put all of our belongings in our luggages ... and triple checked we didn't leave anything in the room, the time we realized things were missing, we noticed - pairs of lady shoes were missing and one was brand new so do you guys a favor and go to another place I will never come back to this place ever again !!",0
 The room it was a superior double and it was small and dark There was nowhere to sit in the room I think this hotel is better for business clients  The location is fantastic for sightseeing around London you can walk to Buckingham Palace and lots of good restaurants near by ,0
 Everything was very good but the staff was extraordinary Especially a young man named Pim who was most helpful with anything we needed  The bed was like a cloud unbelievable ,1

 Being given a tiny single room for 2 OAPs Which they called an Executive room It was furnished with a large bed against one wall one would have had to crawl over to get into bed just enough space to pass on the other side SHOCKING Requested a quiet room After complaint we were given a slightly bigger room Comment definitely not Park Plaza standard A really big disappointment And certainly not value for money  Public areas very pleasant,0

 Poor English with most of the staff really hard pillows and dubious stains on bathroom walls room 209  Restaurant on site does close early so they kick you out at 10 00pm iron and large room safe in room,0
 hmmm I would have preferred bigger beds but that s London for you lovely cosy hotel with the right ambiance,1
 Absolutely filthy could smell urine in the bathroom only to find on the morning we left someone had passed urine up the bathroom door and it had been left Bare wires on lamp dirty stains everywhere Was promised a nice room  The bed,0
 The price quoted for my stay did not include vat 20 Neither did it include the breakfast I would not have booked the hotel had I been aware of this I have never been quoted a price for a hotel that excludes vat exceptionally unfair marketing The Wifi was charged 12 a day  Quiet hotel Ideal for solo traveller Very clean ,1
No Negative Very good breakfast and an enjoyable evening meal with friends ,1
 Bed head was under window so draft on your head When raining out side all you could hear all night was water dripping on the window cill outside Dining are says 11am to 11pm tried to get in for lunch told it was closed after a function Close to train station 5 00 by cab Bar area dose nice lunches and fair price Nice staff ,1
No Negative Perfect location for Albert Hall Very comfortable and friendly,1
 Glass partitions  Great place nice people,1
 Room size Toilet door you can see through Give a view to young families Price too high for size of room Bar too expensive,0
 Room was very very dissappointing for a 5 star hotel room expected a luxurious room we got a very basic room with cold shower and pubic hair in bathroom I asked for a bath but wen we got upgraded we got no bath just a shower it was our honeymoon I was expecting so much more from a 5star hotel at that price iv stayed in nicer rooms at budget hotels wouldn t stay again Restaurant was great for breakfast staff were lovely and spa was fantastic although we would have liked champagne as we were in spa but no food drink policy,0
 Thought breakfast would be included in the price we paid for the room Cookies on arrival,1
 the hotel I was hopeing to get was so looking forward to staying they again not the hotel I booked could not have shower as bath to high very poor for what I paid,0
 I requested a wake up call at 7 45am I got it at 8 17am I had a meeting in the Langham hotel with a chap that flew in from Las Vegas I was embarrassingly late Mention it to reception and they didn t make too much of it  Style of hotel and comfortable bed very important,1
 Pillows were hard and uncomfortable I asked for additional pillows and they were provided however they were not much better Also there were no outlets anywhere near a mirror in order to style hair I asked for an extension and was provided with one which worked okay  Great location spacious room and bathroom,1
 Customer Service is zero  Location,0
 location of hotel and the breakfast area staff s kindness and help,1
 To have to pay the taxi  Great place The Topazz is in The center that was amazing The bedroom was really confortable Everything was well except we booked a vehicle on our arrival we waited 20 minutes and then we took a taxi I really was angry The hotel charged us the taxi I find it shameful for a 5 star there was no organization ,0
 Our keys to our room did not work and there was a big q for reception luckily a maid let us in We paid an extra 24 50 each for the breakfast for the convenience and it was nothing special so if we stayed here again we would eat out locally Our TV kept freezing and the sound was distorted  The lovely Hermes bathroom goodies and robe and slippers The spa was a bonus but a bit on the small side The fun of the gadgets,1
 20 charge on my credit card upon my arrival as a guarantee This is bad for a 4star hotel and I m still waiting to be reimbursed Fresh fruits for breakfast,1
 Nothing Welcoming efficient friendly staff really clean bedroom and communal spaces great location rooftop terrace,1
 Quite far from the city center The entrance from the underground parking to the hotel area was a bit weird clear directions are needed And although it is understandable that not all guests opt for the breakfast menu it was very annoying to have been asked twice about my room number and if I payed for the breakfast  OK place There was nothing special about it really The break fast was ok The rooms were nice and comfy clean as well ,1
 Got a pitch dark room with window facing the inside of the hotel black space between the elevator and the stairs covered by a dark curtain Depressing room and depressing stay and not what i would expect for the price  The service was the best thing about the hotel,0
No Negative The room was very clean The room was cleaned everyday and dirty linens towels replaced with clean ones The hotel s location is superb it s close to every mode of transport The staff are friendly and very helpful ,1
 Apart from the limited space the room was very hot with no way to reduce the temperature The noise from the pipes in the ceiling was very annoying continuous and the staff couldn t do anything about it I hope they can find a solution for this issue If you need wifi you have to go to the reception area no wifi signal in the rooms Breakfast was very disappointing  The small restaurant has nice and very polite staff and offers a range of delicious dishes The steak worth a try Reception staff were very helpful special attributes to Roberta ,1
 The Staff at the reception was very un co operative I made a booking with a child under 8 years old Inspite of that he insisted that for SAFETY RULES of the hotel i had to upgrade my room to simply allow my child to stay No other hotel during my stay made such an absurd comment Also the kitchen was closed and the included breakfast was A la carte and not with options it was more like bread and juice Only choose this hotel for location Not for anything else No Positive,0
"I stayed here because of the price but you get what you pay for. Parking cost is high. Internet and in room coffee both weak. The pool, rooftop deck and fitness room all closed due to emergency maintenance. Too cold to exercise outside. My teenage daughter wanted to sleep in so I tried to get some business done in a too small and dark business center or using one outlet in the lobby by the door where all the smokers smoked. A cold, stinky, uncomfortable place to work so dd could sleep in the room. Not the conveniences I expected. Staff as kind as they could be under the circumstances that they could not meet my needs. I would look harder next time I book in Chicago.",0
"One of the best hotels when you are traveling with kids. Spacious rooms, Friendly staff, everyone goes out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Free breakfast and complimentary drinks are a treat! Great location as well....",1
 Had the feel of a hostel not a hotel  Location ,0
No Negative quiet hotel but transport and shops close at hand,1
 There was a door banging and squeaking even in the early hours spoiled an other wise good stay  The staff were very good and helpful ,0
 This was advertised as a 4 star hotel it is most definitely a 3 star hotel The rooms were tiny and the bathroom very small as well The conservatory photo is deceiving that room is not available for guests except for breakfast we were really hoping to use this room in the afternoon  The bed was fantastic Very comfortable and clean fresh linen,0
 Nothing  Everything about the hotel was beautiful and I would recommend to anyone wanting to visit,1
 N A Lovely clean modern room great shower very comfortable bed Had dinner in the Restaurant excellent food and service ,1
 Hated that there was no coffee or mugs in the room despite there being a kettle and sugar When we asked for some mugs and coffee we were told we would have to buy from the bar so we asked for tea bags they didn t have any ordinary tea Eventually we got some coffee but the milk had gone off We were also given directions to the wrong bus stop which could have been disastrous if a kind lady didnt notice and send us to the right one  Bed was comfy and staff helpful,0
"The hotel was clean and the foyer was large and had a bar and lounge area that was nice. We were with the young kids so this really didnt do anything for us. I found the gentlemen behind the check in counter to be stuffy. DO NOT PARK AT THE HOTEL! We made this mistake and it cost us -- dollars, plus I wasnt sure if we were going to fit our large truck through the tiny garage. We found out later, just across the street was overnight parking for around -- dollars. I am sure it is a nice hotel for a couple, but not really family friendly.",0
 The rooms were tired wood work tatty very noisy air con units rooms too hot No water glasses or water in rooms Accessible entrance is into dining room but requires moving furniture to get wheelchair through Big kerb outside this entrance into Shepherds Mews so the long way around is necessary for wheelchairs  The staff were very eager to help and friendly good position tucked away behind Park Lane and Piccadilly clean towels and good sized mugs for hot drinks,0
 Nothing all good  Location,1
 I liked everything very much the only minus was that I could only stay one night  The hotel is just a few steps from the train station with direct trains to the airport in the noble part of Barcelona I got a lovely room with an amazing terrace overlooking the roofs around The room had a modern design unusual but charming layout pleasant colours and interior materials The building is an elegantly refurbished historic building The staff were pleasant and helpful breakfast delicious lot of local and organic products home made cakes Tea and coffee is available through the whole day there was a welcome glass of cava I will definitely come back ,1
No Negative Such friendly staff upgraded to a suite which was amazing Beautiful antiques and pictures in the room Massive 4 poster bed Will definitely be back,1
 Envinronment is not attractive but the hotel cannot change it Another and againg not hotel related issue is a city tax 15 Euro per room Milan minicipality is killing  the staff is very freindly we arrived at 3 am and nothing was open in the hotel or arround but the desk clerk was very kind and organied for us tea coffee set in the room Check in out is very fast and easy Internet is of strong signal and fast enough Room facilities are clean and well mainained ,1
 Bed could have been a bit comfier mattress was very hard That is just personal preference though Wouldn t stop me from staying here again  Excellent location just a few minutes walk from Euston station Room was a decent size and very clean Nice compact bathroom Option to leave luggage after checkout if you are out and about which is handy We didn t try the restaurant although the menu sounded good and it looked as though it would be nice Checkout isn t until midday as well which was great most places seem to make you leave by 10 or 11 so we were impressed with that ,1
 The hotel is getting old  Friendly staff,0
 For a 5 nights booking we got one single soap in the bathroom Breakfast is too expensive In the morning starting at 7 30am the house keeping crew starts knocking in the doors very laud waking uo all the guests around Its so easy to improve in my dislikes lists that its even strange that its not fixed yet  The location is very good A standard hotel for a fair price in London,0
 Wifi wasn t working well The airco didn t cool the chamber It become very hot due to the sun No Positive,0
 This hotel was very congested with small lobby Rooms very decorated in such a manner that it reduces illumination and it was difficult to find some thing in room All black paint Portraits placed in the room were not very good  The hotel was located in the centre of city of Barcelona The staff was cooperative Staff communication was good Breakfast was ok You can walk around to see some historical sights ,0
No Negative The room was very comfortable restaurant first class and location was great Thank you ,1

No Negative The team were sooo friendly especially John who checked us in Hotel Nottingh Hill is very tidy close to the Heineken experience and museumplein and is great value for money Would recommend this hotel to everyone ,1
 Staff location New clean,0
 Asked for a VAT receipt for the meal I had inside of the hotel promised to provide on check out But when I asked for it next day at check out they refused to provide with very bad attitude Until I started to call booking they changed their attitude and try to solve it for me Feel a bit untreated very bad experience  Location is good for communiting with Canary Wharf companies ,0
 It was a little too expensive for what it was Good location lovely staff,1
"The Palace Hotel is a cool place. It has a grand elegance and appears to have history. The location was great for us. It is within easy walking distance to the Ferry Building. The staff was great and the room was clean and comfortable. Two things to know. The walls are thin. When the folks next door decided to watch TV at --:--pm, I could hear every word (we had to get up at -am for a flight!). Also, the charge to keep your car in their valet garage is $-- per night! They don't tell you this until they have possession of your vehicle. Beware!",1
 Small room felt more like an overnight tourist hotel  The hotel location My room facing the park ,0
 Heating got stuck on 32 during the night 2am Phoned down to reception only to be told we could only get it turned off not down if they sent someone from maintenance We finally got to sleep at 3am only to be woken by a truck delivering the clean linen to the hotel No bath only a shower with only one flannel and one hand bath towel  The location St Pauls is beautiful if a little loud at night but being that close what can you expect ,0
No Negative Completely lacking in character and taste However it is well situated and therefore convenient,0
 A c and room temperature awful very small poor selection of tv channels very little thought to extras that when traveling across the world make you remember the hotel  Bed was very good as were the sheets ,0
 Far from the tube minuscule room horrible noise from the road could not get any sleep thank god I had hearing plugs Only saving grace was very nice staff No Positive,0
 The toilet was in a separate room to the bathroom meaning the wash hand basin was in a different room A little bit further out from the city than we would ve liked but still fine as there were frequent trams only a short stroll away takes roughly 25 minutes to get into the city centre from leaving the hotel Room was comfy and had good facilities also everything was very very clean Very handy for travelling to from airport as only one stop on the train ,0
 5 stars just 100 x  Everything such a beautiful place with an very grand feeling ,1
 room too small no laundry no food no restaurants nothing I do object to this place being dressed up as 4 star how it be when you only get a basic room  locaton is good Free mini bar good price is good,1
 The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful however the bar kitchen staff let the score down They had messed up our food order and rather than apologising and making it right they spent a great deal of time blaming each other for the error The female chef in particular was extremely rude they all gave the impression that they couldn t be bothered with us Which is a big let down compared to how lovely the Reception staff were  Amazing beds ,1
 It was a strange chemical cleanser s smell in our room And also it wasn t possible to open windows We also got a room for disabled people didn t expect it  Good lobby interior,1
"Overall, the hotel was very pleasant. HOWEVER, when I had a guest join me for breakfast one morning, neither the host nor the server bothered to tell us that the buffet was $-- per person. Should I have asked about the cost in advance? Probably. Was it extremely poor form for the staff to deceive us like that? I think so. Hotel restaurants are never cheap, but I believe $-- for eggs and coffee is a bit offensive.",0
 Nothing Rooms very comfortable bed was great too,1
 Noise by guests in the middle of the night building works in the early hours of the morning and when addressed with hotel staff not really any resolution  Room was beautiful and bed was comfy ,0
No Negative Great location if you are travelling by train Well soundproofed rooms ,1
 I disliked everything generally about this hotel First of all the photos on booking com were very misleading This is not a 4 class hotel I would rate it as a 2 class hotel It was absolutely poor value for money  I didn t like anything in particular about this hotel ,0
No Negative I stay at this hotel on a regular basis as it s a 3 minute walk from my daughter s flat and provides free parking Putney has lots to offer bars restaurants and shops It s so very easy to get the train into the centre of London or out to Wimbledon The hotel s Garden Rooms are quiet modern and immaculately clean ,1
 The hotel is 3 max There was even cockroach in the bathroom No robes or sleepers Bathroom size is tiny Furniture from 80th we came two people but everything in the room was only for one Sink was broken Awful No Positive,0

No Negative We were looking for a hotel in the centre of the city with a balcony or terrace AC Wifi in the room We found it The hotel is located 5 minutes walk to St Stephens Platz to Metro There is a Big Bus tour and a taxi stop near the hotel There are restaurants supermarkets in the neighborhood The view from the balcony is nice The suite is spacious clean a large bathroom is with all bath stuff The staff are friendly ,1
No Negative Clea room Great location ,1
 the price of the breakfast the bed was very confortable,1
 Food leftovers under the bed Dust in cabinet of watercooker Windows were dirty Glasses and coffee cups were dusty and dirty Compared to the last time i stayed there not a lot of things changed That is 8 years ago Maintenance is poor Staff is ok but not well trained Wondering if one of them has the Hotel school certificate Suggest to clean and fix things in the hotel Elevator got stuck for example Otherwise they can loose license This is not the Best Western as it was but more a hotel like in the red light district  I was upgraded but bedroom was not really clean ,0
 Noting worth mentioning  Great location for getting around town due to location of tube ,1
 If this hitel was 3 or 4 stars maybe i will be satisfied about every thing even the room price but I can t call this hotel a 5 star hotel Nothing,0

 Room was in basement and though clean was very claustrophobic and as the window looked out on to the metal stairs outside I was woken early on Sat morning by people running up and down and shouting morning greetings to each other outside  Clean and convenient,0
 The hotel has had plenty of money thrown at the foyer but don t let that trick you The rooms and adjoining hallways plus lifts are old antiquated and smell of stale cigarette smoke The location is not conducive to anything London has to offer except if you are going to work in canary wharfNo Positive,0
 The swimming pool in the spa was beautiful But it doesn t look like it gets cleaned until the end of the day piles of used towels and robes everywhere No clean towels in the men s changing rooms Floors were filthy We actually didn t stay long because of this  The staff were so friendly whether at check in or at one of the two bars The rooms are finished to a high standard as you would expect with Intercontinental Superb luxurious bathrooms Again high quality finish Loved the Eighteen sky bar and clipper bar expensive drinks which is a shame I d like to have stayed longer ,1
No Negative Fantastic staff Friendly and helpful Went out of their way to make out stay pleasant and easy ,1
 Rude staff when I asked why my account was charged 100 I wasn t informed this money would be taken Construction work on a Sunday morning and not once was I contacted informing me of this work I would have booked another hotel Kept up a lot of the night by the lift saying going up going down Poor hotel wouldn t expect to pay 100 for two nights never mind 300  Good location for Euston tube,0

 Room very small in corner location Sink holding water Fixtures and fittings very worn Room cleanliness poor During the night the fire alarm activated and we had to exit to the muster point We were met by a large group of drunk Barnsley footballers and supporters but no Hotel Fire Marshall After some time we returned to reception and had to find a member of staff who told us a call point had been smashed but that this was malicious The fire brigade did not attend and no apparent check was made of the hotel to ensure there was no fire a presumption was made that it was a false alarm  God facilities and location,0
 not all staff are helpful some are very helpful and some are just create the negative experience for customers the hotel has been renovated from some years and it was a real pleasure in the past to stay at this hotel now a lot of stuff needs renovation for example wall painting furniture as the value for money starts to decrease comparable to nearby hotels  location cleanness,0

 Bar service poor food average qualityNo Positive,0
 Bathroom a little tired  The rooms were very warm great in winter when so often hotel rooms are cold or the heating needs to be switched on Bed very comfy ,1
No Negative Well I was not sure how to rate this place as there is one big issue they also have rooms in the basement with fake windows that look out on the hall for the same price as the rooms on the standard floors This is a real disgrace to offer basement rooms for over a hundred pounds For such room I wouldn t rate them more than 6 7 But after my complain they moved me to the room on the second floor so I must rate them based on what I had and the room was very nice everything new modern style clean and with nice small kitchenette Also the area around this hotel is pretty nice and in walking distance from metro station and beautiful Holland Park ,1
 Booked 2 superior rooms each 30m2 but instead got one 20m2 and another 18m2 and wasn t informed beforehand and was charged the same price and after a big discussion they said we don t have other rooms so take or leave it So got a refund and left so you won t get what they re advertising  Nice location ,0

 The room was so pokey it was a joke and for 150 per night it was poor value We were tricked into thinking there were two kingsize beds in the room because of a mirror next to the only bed in the advertising picture Not happy at all  The night receptionist let us eat in the lobby because there was no room in our executive king room ,0

 I didn t like when the staff room service kept opening the room door as soon as they knocked without waiting for a response from the guest who s inside the room I had to put do not disturb sign on the door and lock the door with the key because of this move  Nice clean spacious hotel room and bathroom As expected ,1
 Breakfast service very slow Understaffed No plates available Very limited choice from the breakfast bar The swimming pool was not in operation during the 3 days we stayed in this hotel No explanation was given Just bad service without excuses from the staff The train connection Thameslink did not run at all during 25 26 and 27th of December The hotel staff was not aware Our planned connection from Luton Airport to the hotel did not work for that reason It took finally about 1 hour longer then it was said No Positive,0

"Unfortunately after a day out we returned to find our liquor had been taken, not just a little bit but two bottles at one litre each completly gone. I went straight to front desk and even thought they were most professional i got the feeling that it wasnt uncommon. I was required to call house keeping to enquire to what happened to them the next day and no one really seemed to concerned that someone had helped them self to it. The amount was credited against my account but still feel pretty disappointed that this happened.
 In regards to the actual room it is a very basic but acceptable room. As previously mentioned paper thin walls and we could hear everything the next room was talking about. Not just noise but clearly understand every word.",0
 A more exciting breakfast delivered to room We had a few small croissants and bread jam  We can see the Eiffel Tower clearly from the room The penthouse also has a huge balcony ,1

 Shower Bath water was cold called reception several times and nothing was sorted Came in on Saturday night and the staff on reception was so close with each other flirting and touching each other made me feel so uncomfortable The room wasn t cleaned even though we left the sign on the door I feel disappointed with the stay when paying so much money I would like to be able to be in contact with manager As I would like a refund  The view from the room was brilliant ,0

"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Dec --th for one night. The rooms were nice and clean. Average bathroom. The view from the lounge on the --th floor was fantastic. We were offered a suite upgrade for $--, but we declined. We paid $-- on the Hyatt website. Biggest issue was the very hard mattresses and parking charges. There is a Starbucks across the street. I was suprised that there were no restaurants near the hotel. Location was close to Union Square.",0
 The room was tiny and the TV temperamental Clean enough Breakfast pretty good ,0
"This hotel has only improved with age. The staff is helpful and professional, the rooms are extremely comfortable, the concierge lounge is well managed, and the location cannot be beat if you like to haunt the North End for food. Have tried other hotels in Boston and have found that this property consistently delivers on comfort, service and convenience at a good value.",1
 We paid extra for a Eiffel tower view room but didn t have any view of it at all except for a tiny tip at the top over the back of some ugly buildings that are being renovated The room was very over priced it was small dark and very much in need of updating We have asked the manager to contact us about the fact that this is not what we had signed up for but haven t had any communication with him at all Very disappointed indeed which cost us e750 for 2 nights for the room only for that price we would expect to have much better facilities and a far better room and at least what it says on the advert  The location of the Hotel was perfect and staff friendly ,0

"I had read some bad reviews about this hotel and was slightly concerned, but not enough to cancel my reservations. Thank God I didn't! The staff was amazing!!! Everyone was so nice and helpful, especially the restaraunt staff. They couldn't have been kinder. Our room was clean and the bed comfortable. Also, we had come to San Antonio to take our granddaughter to SeaWorld and Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch. This hotel's location made it super easy to get to both places and return back to the hotel. There are also several decent restaraunts around the hotel if you don't want eat at the hotel. The only two suggestions I have are the room didn't stay really cool at night and the food at dinner is way too fancy. Other than that we had a grand time, and will definitely look at the Doubletree again when we come back through.",1

 Our room temp was in the mid 80s when we checked in and it took the AC nearly 24 hrs running continuously to bring it to a manageable level Also surprised by the 10 different large cracks in the walls as the building has settled  Breakfast setup was very good,1
 Bedroom really nice except shower too close to wardrobe when two people trying to shower and dress at the same time Lovely and very unusual layout of hotel ,1
 Room was awful pull out bed was terrible room to small for 3 people and across the road was a party going on till 2 in the morning so noice levels were awful Worst thing though was the pull out bed it was absolutely dreadful  Hotel was ok staff were good ,0

"Stayed three nights on business. 
I had an interior facing room, so no view, but also no traffic noise at night. It was very quiet. The room was quite large. Huge closet.
The bed was very comfortable. Some of the place sleep I've had at a hotel. The bathroom was large and clean.
The lobby was large, with a number of places to sit. This was convenient when waiting for my business partner. Very old school with very ornate decor.
The main dining room, Laural Court, is painted with landscape murals. A lovely room. Wait staff were very old school - literally. Food was so so.
The Tonga Room & Hurricane Bar was a blast. Very different from the rest of the property.",1
 Check in is supposedly at 3 00 pm We were drenched in a rainstorm when we arrived at 3 10 pm We had to sit in the small lobby soaking wet for half an hour before our room was ready Every morning there were bags of dirty linen cleaning supplies and cleaning carts cluttering up the narrow hallways The staff while not necessarily rude were rather aloof and not exactly welcoming Probably would not return  Location Directly across the street from the Mouton Duvetnet metro stop and just a couple blocks from the RER B to both CDG and Orly It seemed clean ,0
"Have to say I've heard and read horror stories, but, honestly We had a very enjoyable stay. staff very friendly and willing to go the extra mile for me and my family, The pool was refreshing and the staff was there to make sure things were ok, towels, drinks, etc. I do admit the hotel is not new but the extras offered and location made our stay worth it . I also understand after reading a lot of these reviews most people thought they were in a - star hotel and paying ---.-- a night for it .. and that a lot of travelers feel the need to complain about life rather than make the best of it ..",0

 Lifts are a bit slow Buffet breakfast excellent lots of choice cooked cold meats fruit ,1
 The room was not soundproofed which we observed during the daytimes and resulted in a disrupted final night s sleep Our complaint was taken by reception staff around 02 30am and action has not yet been followed up by the hotel manager as promised We were situated in a corner suite and disappointed by the lack of privacy not forgetting the expense of the room We declined the option of sending security as our neighbours were only talking and vomiting not shouting or partying and did not feel they were at fault to escalate the situation  Excellent location near the metro and local amenities Fun relaxing concept mixing students with visitors ,0

"I always love staying at the Four Seasons Austin. The service is outstanding, the beds are very comfortable, the lobby bar is fun, the views of the lake are great and the location is central. The hotel has great showers and products too, which is important to me when traveling. Staying at the hotel is always a relaxing experience from the moment you walk into the lobby and I highly recommend this as your top choice when in Austin. I stay here a few time a year for work and try to make it once or twice for pleasure as well.",1

 We stayed in a building that was outside the hotel In the middle of the two buildings they are building the last part of the hotel so to go either for breakfast or reception we had to go outside Also the triple room that we booked was not the room that was given it was much smaller and after explaining the situation the staff gave us another double room  The staff was very friendly and tried to solve the situation ,0

 I booked a single cozy room which was absolutely perfect for one traveler but the bed was very uncomfortable I also don t think the cleaning crew changed the sheets during my week long stay there were several stains on them  The location just can t be beat So close to everything The hotel is beautiful and all the staff is wonderful I had a quick lunch is The Lounge one day and it was delicious ,1

 The 4 star rating is not deserved by this hotel The staff doesn t pay attention to the guests or does it as a great favor rather than their jobs Your arrival at the hotel starts with you carrying your suitcases up the welcome stairs while the concierges and other staff attending the valet parking and desks My room had a window into the internal ventilation non garden with fans producing constant noise Luckily I was staying in this hotel in September as I don t think it is survivable in Summer due to lack of A C Furniture and bathroom are weared off to the level of a 2 star motel Oh and remember to take flip flops when you are going to the shower Chances are the floor will have a nice big puddle when you finish  Location nothing else ,0

"This old hotel has beautiful woodwork and some grand old furnishings that once must have smacked of royalty. These days they seem to be collecting dust or waiting to be repainted or refurbished. The rooms facing away from the street may be quieter but they also tend to be dark and unappealing. The location is somewhat convenient to downtown but the neighborhood has little to offer in the way of restaurants or interesting walking trips. at around a hundred bucks with a nice expanded continental breakfast, you'll be getting your money's worth in a town that is not known for cheap lodging.",0

 We paid a lot of money for a 5 night stay and unfortunately our evening flight to Batcelona was delayed so we didn t arrive at the hotel until midnight We were allocated a nice room which was modern and nicely decorated Sadly at 7 30 in the morning the shop refurbishment next door started and we were woken by a hammer drill drilling into the wall The hotel staff moved us to a suite on the 7th floor which had great views but had tired decor and electrics that tripped out when we used the iron Value for money was poor and I wouldn t return again  The location was very close to everything which was very handy We used room service a couple of times which was prompt courteous and the food was good ,0

"My family and I LOVED the Omni Parker Hotel!!! Being history and literature buffs we were thrilled with the historical past of the hotel and we were very excited to discover all of the famous authors who have stayed at the Parker House in the past. The staff was incredibly helpful as well. When I had to run down the street to a --Eleven on an extremely chilly night a bellman even offered to lend me his coat when he saw I wasn't wearing one! The only thing I wished they had was wireless internet access in all the rooms. (But that was the ONLY thing I felt the hotel was lacking.) The hotel was beautiful, the room was comfortable, the food was excellent, and the staff were incredibly helpful. We can't wait to stay there again!",1
"Very responsive host that was contactable throughout the stay. Do note that this accommodation has three floors with no lift (steep & narrow stairway) and theres a pond right behind the door of level 2 & 3. Although entrance is located in a small alley, it felt like we were living in a cozy cottage once we stepped in. 5 seconds to Hoan Kiem lake is accurate as well. Fully equipped with universal power adapters, wine glasses and anything else you might need :) Spacious for 2 in each room, but might be a bit of a squeeze for 3.",1
 view All good except there was a spider behind the minibar ,1
 Constant siren noise from outside All bloody night Can t breathe if I close the window Shower no pressure Can t wash properly No proper parking  Near enough to the centre,0
 Check in staff were rude and aggressive Not at all helpful and very dismissive of me using Booking com  Free Wi Fi and the actual room fittings,0
No Negative Everything,1
 The room was tiny no air conditioning so very warm through the night Everything was in the way of the plugs A double bed but against a wall not easy to get in and out off They call it the Cosy Double don t be fooled cosy tiny  The location was good ,0
 Bathroom located in the room separated from the bed by a curtain Smell from the restaurant in the halls  Location Breakfast,0
 Room was smallest room ever stayed in Paris It should win an award  Great local restaurant,0
 Too much attention on tech hardware resulting in a less enjoyable experience in term of comfortNo Positive,0
 The room is small but it s typical for London We never took breakfast in the hotel a because nice places with good English or whichever breakfast are in walking distance and at a more reasonable price b the place for breakfasts and a bar and a part of a hallway all in one had bad ventilation and always was full of smells It was neither good for the guests passing by to the elevators nor for the guests having breakfast  Convenient location pretty clean and welcoming staff Paddington station is in around 10 minutes walk close to the Hyde park 2 tube stations from Notting Hill Gate which can be reached by feet as well if you like to walk ,1
 Bathroom was awful A huge shallow sink that splashed water everywhere and meant ZERO bench space The hair dryers a disaster Small shower small toilet huge bath that you really dont need No good for women travellers who need to SEE themselves in the mirror and lay out products We requested a proper hairdryer but nothing was available Might sound small but a 5 star hotel needs to offer better  Beds room location welcome ,0
 The room was really quite small and the breakfast options were pretty basic and not at all worth the 12 15 per head that they were asking  The room was clean and modern and the bed was very comfy Staff were lovely and polite Loved the fact that they offered free parking which was very important to us as we were driving from Manchester ,0
No Negative Complimentary snacks light lunch and soft drinks daily from 1 00 7 00 at poolside was very much appreciated and a great feature ,1
 The shower wasn t working properly I guess there wasn t enough time to fix it within 2 days  Sindy was fabulous welcoming helpful and informative My next visit to Paris definitely includes me staying there ,1
 No slippers available hallways had bad smell sometimes they charged 10 euros for the adapter which all hotels provide with deposit the young guy in the reception was rude and not helpful at all Free parking onsite and is almost always available modren room furniture very close to metro station red line which takes you directly to Milan Duomo in less 20 mins,0
 The parking was sometimes overloaded One gentlemen at the desk was very rude and shouted back when late at night he was requested to assist in showing the location of the parking He said he didn t care for the consequences and reviews Go and complain to whoever you want That s not quality service in my opinion  Location parking value,0
 the hotel is close to some hospitals thus the whole day and night there were ambulances noise  i liked how pullmann provide service to its clients very efficiently ,0
 Room way too small even for solo traveller problems with credit card needed the same card reservation was booked with which wasnt stated when booking Breakfast v basic and unappealing Room clean and nice bathroom,0
 i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room No Positive,0
 Squeaky bed Asked for double got two singles Lack of storage no tea and coffee and no natural light in the room The sound proofing of the room was terrible and so we could hear the lift and reception coversations throughout the night and in the morning Location was good definitely not four star facilities Staff were helpful,0
 The speed of service when ordering bar meals left a lot to be desired and food was lukewarm  The location is excellent,1
 Although it s a 4 star hotel not many amenities in the building basically it is a place to sleep New Hotel nice size of room compare to those old luxurious ones because the old ones are usually small,1
"I had a prompt check, and a nice quiet inside facing room in the club level. It was just perfect for a quick - night work trip. Definately recommended.",1
 Awesome experience in a hotel which supposedly has 4 stars Horrible welcome at the reception hotel is so big it s likely to be overcrowded elevator and breakfast area the location is also horrible right next to the train station and surrounded by abandoned houses on both sides also the roads are new ant the GPS does not know the right way to this horrible purple castle Rooms are big but seem to be partially furnished there is no information about minibar prices or other important info about the hotel there is no shower curtain so the whole bathroom will be flooded after shower and on top of that there will be some roosters singing you a happy morning song around 7am in the morning  Nothing ,0
 Expensive But worth it  Fantastic view on the quay very big and confortable bed ,1
 The room we had was awful absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke Had to pay to use the Wifi which is such a joke after paying so much to stay there and don t think the service was up to standard for a Hilton Hotel as stayed in many before over the world No Positive,0

"Mu husband and I have stayed at the Swissotel - years in a row on one of the busiest November weekends for Chicago, the Festival of Lights. The Swissotel's staff has gone out of their way both years to give us a beautiful room and superb service. The front desk and concierge service have made our stays hassle free and memorable. The hotel itself is exactly what you would expect from a chic Chicago Hotel. We are looking forward to November ---- at the Swissotel!",1

 Calm but rather featureless even boring area Personnel managed to pass one message on the hotel s style correct but rather pretentious and certainly lacking all type of charm No Positive,0
 Booked a room without breakfast The booking confirmation said breakfast costs 13 per person per night The staff member at check in said the same The staff member at check out insisted I pay 16 for the breakfast explaining that 13 would have been the price if I had booked the breakfast on the internet and that her colleague at check in must have got it wrong Call it what you may this kind of behaviour is reason enough for me never to return whatever the other merits of this hotel are No Positive,0
 The pool area had green mould on the floor on the steps to get in out the pool one of the supporting arms was loose  The hotel was warm and comfortable the room was clean and the bed and shower great the pool water was warm ,1
 REALLY didn t want to get out of the bed Ridiculously comfortable lol My stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton was absolutely amazing The staff were exceptional the room was immaculate extremely spacious with a bed I REALLY didn t want to get out of Breakfast was more than excellent value amazing quality with a wide choice of items for every diet taste Best hotel I ve ever stayed at I will definitely be back ,1

No Negative Excellent location for shopping however if you want to be close to the action ie dam sq it s a bit of a walk ,0
 Some of the rooms have no lift access and the stairs were uneven It is also difficult to hail a cab we had to walk at least two blocks to a busy street But using Uber is a great alternative cheaper too The bed sheets were rough so were the towels Free bottled water wasn t replenished daily  The staff were so friendly chatty and helpful To accommodate our requests we got moved from Park Grand Lancaster Gate to Park Grand Paddington which is just around the corner of PGLG it is newly renovated The neighboorhood was quiet with a cafes and small ethnic restaurants within one block radius There s a pharmacy and marts as well ,1

"We had a reservation at the Best Western in Old Town but after visiting the San Diego Visitor center, they suggested this Ramada Inn for less money. What a terrible mistake we made cancelling our reservation at the Best Western. After visiting Old Town, we realized we made a big mistake. The Best Western would have been a better choice---better location by far and so much nicer. Well worth the price we would have paid. The Ramada Inn was awful- so run down, beds were so uncomfortable-very old mattresses, springs popping out, mattress had hills and valleys. The room was worth about $--, a night, not the great price of $--. Staff was nice, but do yourself a big favor and stay somewhere else.",0
 No Taxi rank outside Close to the Hammersmith Apollo,0
 The room didn t haven t any conditioner so bring it with you and the bed only had a sheet there was a blanket in the cupboard but as a cold person I definitely could have done with some sort of duvet The pool also needed more seats and loungers as we couldn t get a seat  Good transport links and easy to walk everywhere we walked right into the city every evening Room service was nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The pool was a nice size and wasn t too cold ,1
 Servise Crazy service,0
 Breakfast the usual help yourself cooked or buffet style very clean and tidy looked good but most of the items were only slightly warm at best cold scrambled egg not my choice It will look better when front renovations are finished now June 2016 Straight off the Paris train to bedroom in 15 minutes flat Very efficient staff very quiet rooms and English speaking a bonus Thank you Barcelona doesn t seem to wake up early on a Saturday ,1

 The reception was too small Wifi didn t always work in our bedrooms The breakfast was not adequate in variety and quantity There was not enough crockery The waiter had to wash our existing cutlery one morning We were at breakfast for 10 15am Breakfast finishes at 10 30am There were no crossionts no bread no eggs The waiter went to make some and bought back raw dough croissants The hotel is more like a 2 3 star  The bed was comfortable ,0
 We had one rude member of staff who told us when picking up baggage to hurry up when we had been waiting 10 minutes for him to let us get our cases even the receptionist was annoyed with his rudeness Otherwise the rest of the staff were lovely  The breakfast was lovely and most of the staff were lovely The location is fantastic and the rooms are spacious ,0
 For the price I paid I thought the room was quite small Also the shower was fairly basic and not very powerful I ve stayed in other Holiday Inn hotels that were less than half the cost of this one but much better  The location was perfect for the event I was attending as it was just behind the hotel The staff were great and very helpful The view from the room was good as I was on the 25th floor and the room was clean The lady at reception changed me to a double bed as originally it had been a twin bed and it was very comfortable The air conditioning worked well too ,1
 Tried to offer me a completely different hotel When I saw that hotel I declined The room I got was so small especially the bathroom TV not working properly a security light shone in the room all night the air con didn t work so it was hot in the room Breakfast is extra but there are plenty of cafes around there so don t bother  When I could check out ,0
"I gave the Courtyard a rating of -, but that's considering the hotel in the context of its price and location.
The room was fine, although someone must have slept on a really awful bed to rave about the Courtyard's beds; they're average. Actually, average pretty much describes the Courtyard. There's nothing surprising or particularly nice about this hotel. The rooms are very clean and nicely sized, but that's what I'd expect. 
The positive exception to its average character is the staff. The desk staff are above average in speedily getting you through check-in and check-out, and the cleaning staff are unobtrusive and very competent. 
The bathroom items supplied are below average. You probably want to bring your own body lotion, shampoo & conditioner.
However, for $--- a night without breakfast at a hotel so conveniently located, average is pretty good.",1
 Bathroom was tiny ended up with my knees against the bathtub Got upgraded to a great premium room ,1
 Was at the Pizza Hut conference The evening meal was appalling 4 people out of 12 could not eat as their dietary require vegetarian lactose intolerant etc Apparently we had informed you but this is only anicdotal My food was ok except the starter which was wired Also how can you justify charging 19 10 for a pint of Stella and a vodka and coke 2 50 for a dash of Pepsi  Great staff very fiendly excellent facilities ,0

 There is nothing I could complain about  The hotel was lovely and very comfortable we stayed for 3 nights It was in an excellent location next to 3 metro stops so made travel very straightforward We were very kindly upgraded to a superior room when we arrived which was a lovely surprise I left behind my iPad and the hotel made a huge effort to communicate with me regarding this and posted this out to me promptly and made sure it arrived safely a service I am so grateful for I would defintlg recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a great stay in Paris ,1

 Double bed barely fit into very tiny room Space was cramped Heating unit had mind of its own and did not regulate temp correctly We feel room was overpriced for a renovated building that was noisy  Breakfasts were awesome and staff was very attentive However if I had booked direct breakfast would have been free As it was we had to pay 20 pounds for breakfast every day ,0
No Negative Excellent stayed in one of the new refurbished rooms beautiful huge walk in shower loved the new decor windows opened onto the street the staff at this hotel are all very friendly helpful especially Christina who is amazing and an asset to this hotel good breakfast will stay here again ,1
 If you are on business trip I don t recommend as Internet connection there is really bad Rooms are rather dark and unpleasant Breakfasts are really poor  Personnel at the reception was rather nice and location of the hotel is just next to the metro station which is perfect ,0
 Despite booking the room several months in advance and requesting a double bed the original twin room was far to small Our first room was very small with two single beds pushed together however afternoon speaking to reception we were great locmoved the following night to a far larger and more comfortable room ,1
 As a single female traveller I felt unsafe as door had no working lock The single room was also extra tiny Overall place is shabby and most certainly not 4 stars I Felt seriously misled by 4 star rating I did not stay in the end as thankfully found friend to stay with instead after seeing how dreadful this place truely is Don t be tempted by the price Whatever money you spend here is too much Please read the reviews on tripadvisor Do not book here  Nothing ,0

"We only stayed - night at this hotel, but the room was spacious and easily accomodated - people (- in the bedroom, - in the lounge area). Tons of wardrobe space. $- breakfast is good value and very convenient. This hotel is not cheap, but we got it as part of a deal with British Airways which cut the cost hugely. If they could have accomodated us for further nights at this discount we would have stayed. No mini bar in the room, but Duane Reade is just down the street which is handy if you want to buy any soft drinks, snacks etc.",1
 Going home  There was nothing not to like about the hotel ,1
 Dated decor with untidy finishes poor layout of room no bedside table or sockets generally a little dull Good location short walk from tube stop loads of restaurants and takeaways located near,0

 Hotel was through a renovation which although it didn t compromise many of the facilities it surely affect the normal business i e lift reception area entrance  Junior suite upgrade was certainly a positive gesture ,1
 Everything Nothing Over priced very uncomfortable beds extremely expensive more than double the price of everywhere we have stayed on our trip laundry service was 75 for just a few items I paid 360 a night and they would not include breakfast in that price And the breakfast was well below par Would never stay here again ,0

 Checkin time at 3pm was very late When we did go to check in there was a queue which was very slow It took around 30 mins to check in We were charged 12 5 service charge in the bar which was ridiculous considering on one day we were the only ones in there and yet still had to wait quite a bit for our drinks Then later on we had to clear our glasses off the table ourselves as no one came near our table It was also quite difficult to go to restaurant with a buggy during busy times as only one lift serviced the restaurant and lifts are tiny so it was always full Staff very friendly and breakfast was lovely,1
 The price is slightly high Location is superb adjacent to Paddington station lively neighborhood and comfortable ,1
 Small room no laundry bags not enough toiletries cold staff with a few exceptions Location,0

 Food quality was poor both morning and evening A buffet breakfast should not be beyond the ability of a hotel catering team but it seems they managed it two days running Dinner was also below the standard you would expect for a hotel of this calibre  Good location for getting into central London the tube station was 2 minutes walk away Triple glazing reduced traffic noise totally ,0

 Staff need to pick up phone calls and there was no fridge I previously booked a queen room it was better than the King room because the King room didn t have all the complimentary essentials for some reason Bedding was creased and looked rushed Tv wiring was seen instead of hidden  Quality and vibe was fantastic Area is prestigious Cookie from the reception was nice Free tickets to ferry was great didn t use it though ,1

 The location and hotel amenities in respect of sound proofing were limited and did not meet my personal requirements  Esteban Garcia the hotel s Community Manager was excellent and prompt in responding to certain problems that I experienced during my stay The hotel staff and management team are helpful professional and approachable I very much appreciated the personal responses to my questions ,0
 Charged twice for the room as the poor mannered male receptionist insisted on that payment hadn t been taken 2 months ago So charged by card again The payment had been taken and was refunded by the happy female receptionist the next day Also asked the male for the sink trap to be emptied as water would drain away in the bathroom Next day still not done so had to do myself with loads of hair and a mini toothpaste container the cause of the blockage No Positive,0
No Negative I don t like the staff and the price,0
Terrible service. Very noisy. Drug activity is in the building. You would be a fool to stay there. Management is also clueless. The Island Inn or the J Street Inn are better locations.,0
"The hotel is only a few walking minutes away and in the center of Magnificent Mile - Navy Pier and Millenium Park (where """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The Bean"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is located). 
A liitle bit datet but very clean, spacious (for a city hotel) rooms with large LCD screen, very nice and large bathroom and comfortable beds.
Instead of booking a standard room in one of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stylish"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hotels you will get a room in this hotel with a gorgeous lakeview (check roomtype while booking or ask at checkin for upgrades) for the same price.
Tip: Parking in the Millenium Garage is only --$ for --h and only a few steps away from the hotel. Use the garage """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Monroe Street"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (it´s a complex of - garages) and the exit """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Randolph Street"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".",1

 Claiming to be a five star and to have opened in the summer this hotel actually just opened with all the decoration smells There is not even a single chair or desk in the standard room and there is no space for them anyway Watch very carefully the staff have lots of rules to enforce on the guests and you may easily incur a charge of around 50 euro if you check out a little bit later than 12pm  Location is not bad some staff tried to be good,0

"Booked - rooms at what I thought a good rate. At check out they would not honor the rate. Check your confirmation email carefully, rate is not on all of them. Also did not confirm the rate in writing at the time of check in. So for $--- a night we got outdated small rooms, towels that belong in a motel, one room with a leaking closet, several rooms with water stains on the ceiling, free bottled water and arrogant attitude. The customer is never right and you're lucky you got a reservation. I will admit the beds were comfortable and the location for our stay was great but definitely not worth $--- a night.",0

We stayed here for - nights and had a very pleasant stay. The location was good for downtown San Diego and Balboa Park and the staff were helpful with directions and ideas for restaurants. The room size was fine and the bed very comfortable. The only complaint really was when we checked out they said we had watched - films which we had not (- of them while we were not even in the room) and we had to push quite hard to get the charges removed and they were quite off-ish about it all. Apart from that it was all good!,1

 The duty manager could not understand why we was unhappy I demanded our room and they removed the suitcase they did remove a small amount of extra from the bill but considering we paid 258 per night not good enough would not return When we arrived at 4pm our room was not ready we had booked a club room and was advised that we could use another room and change to the room at 5pm I expressed that this was not good enough the hotel had allowed a previous guest to leave their suitcase in our room,0
"I had booked the hotel on the recommendation of the New-York Historical Society, where we were hosting an event the next night; - of my colleagues and the guest speaker made the same decision, and we all had very positive experiences. While rooms are not huge (this is NYC!), they are very well appointed, spotlessly clean and quiet, regardless of whether you are facing --th, Amsterdam or the courtyard. The front desk was extremely helpful as I prepared for the event, printing items up for me and delivering them to my room without being asked to. Would definitely stay here again.",1

Rooms are clean and ours overlooked the marina and the view went on forever. I will stay here again the next time we go to San Diego. Breakfast was free and it was great. If you walked away hungry it was your fault. Parking was good and having the beach and walk way right across the street was nice. There are so many different ships in the bay and the view is great. LOVED this place.You won't be disappointed if you stay here. Location is close to so many of the sights in town and easy to get to.",1
"Find a cheap rate for a king size room at the Palmer in Chicago. Was very excited until I stepped into the room. The bed was taking all the room space.

Staying for business, I got a room on the -nd floor right by the elevators which (a) was noisy hearing children & others making noise while waiting for the elevator & (b) didn't have the spacious bathroom which many others wrote about on the site [regular showerhead in a small bathtub in a small bathroom - no separate shower]. 
In all my corporate stays with SPG, I've always gotten nice rooms but this one felt like it could have been the worst room in the hotel. 
On the plus side, parking was free as they had a large parking area and the Domains restaurants were walking distance away. Since the hotel is away from downtown, the exterior area is quiet at night (even if the hallways were not).",0

 Very hot hotel  Good location A lot of money for the very small room but is only to be expected in the location ,0
"I stayed for - nights in Oct ---- during a business-holiday trip and I am sorry to say I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
The rooms are tiny, even on NYC hotel standards and there is almost no wardrobe space because the closet is almost entirely taken up by the minibar.
Staff is rude and pretentious and there was constant noise in the middle of the night coming from the hallways. I've been to many hotels that go for the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""no reception"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" concept but Cooper Sq really doesn't pull it off, with long waits and poor service.
Given the price ($---+ per night as I upgraded my room), definitely not worth it. 
I will be staying at Bowery Hotel next door (which unfortunately was fully booked this time) next time...!",0
 Better room service menu Only 4 or 5 items available after 12  The best part about this hotel was the location The location is a bit touristy but centrally located so that you can walk to most attractions The hotel was clean and had a historic vibe to the outside We ended up staying at this location because the price was very similar to a lower star hotel The size of the room was much larger than the other hotels in the area The staff were helpful with directions and using the public transportation There was a nice bar in the building that we didn t use They also appeared to be doing renovations on a restaurant at the location ,1
"Hotel is new with modern look. Room was large with small refrigerator. Bathroom has sink with granite counter tops and standup shower. There is a pool and hot tub outside and an outdoor courtyard with fireplace. Gym is nice with treadmills, bikes, ellipiticals, and free weights. I had limited interaction with staff but they seemed nice. some roadwork going on outside the hotel and the road the hotel is located was hectic and busy. Hotel is right off of I---. It meets the standards I would expect for a Courtyard Marriott.",1

 The only minor grumble I can make is the pillows were far too soft for me personally It would have been nice to have a choice of pillows ie 2 soft and 2 firm  The staff were incredibly friendly yet professional Literally nothing was too much trouble The entire hotel was spotlessly clean and had a very welcoming feeling ,1

 Nothing  We stayed here overnight for the London Marathon my daughter participated in it to raise money for her Charity Project Sulangan for the deprived children in a village in the Philippines The hotel was brilliant The staff could not do enough for us and the runners of the marathon from the atmosphere to the food everything were geared for the marathon runners We checked out after breakfast on the morning of the marathon they offered us if we would like to come back to freshen up The location along the river next door to the train just perfect If we go to London for a weekend this would be perfect away from the hectic hustle and bustle of the city yet just a few minutes on the train perfect ,1

 We didn t like the fact that we had to ask several times for toiletries to be put according to the number of people in the room 4 because the replacement was deficient We also didn t like the way one female staff member responded impatiently to a request we had since we were facing difficulties in a foreign country  What we liked best was the perfect location which allowed us easy access to practically everywhere we wanted to go We also felt welcomed by most of the staff We liked the way staff responded promptly to a technical problem we had with the fridge when we arrived ,0
 Reception staff isn t very professional doesn t know much of how they should treat a customer In a luxury hotel Bar closes super early and they basically kick you out even if you re staying in the hotel  Staff is very unfriendly Didn t even explain you have to use your card on the main hotel entrance in the evening Only said they don t open doors ,0

 Staff not listening to what you order The wife booked a hair appointment and this was fully confirmed by the hotel manager but when she went for the appointment nobody was there She called reception who did nothing Waited 30 mins and went to reception to be advised that the hair dresser had an accident and could not make it The hotel is also very dark and not really up to four star standard yet alone the claimed five star Also the hotel and it s story is all fabricated by its owner Built in a lie I guess which sets the tone Dissapointed and would not return Bathroom was very clean,0
Cham is an amazing host and has a stunning property - its a bit of a walk from the old quarters (circa 15/20 mins for 2 x 24 yr olds) but worth it if you want somewhere to relax for a night or two in Hanoi.,1

"-) Bathroom floor didn't look clean due to grout color. Some grout was white and appeared clean but some grout was dark and made me wonder whether it was clean or not.
-) Toilet flush is forceful and too brief to adequately clean the bowl.
-) The TV menu system is quite slow to operate and looks quite outdated. Compared with DirecTV, it seems archaic.

 To be completely honest it was way too expensive for what you get Yes the hotel rooms are nice but the location really isn t the best We had to walk miles to get to desirable areas and the restaurants around the hotel are either non existent or just not good Wish they were more helpful with finding reserving taxis as well  The rooms were comfortable The shower head is amazing and they are very generous when it comes to extra towels and linens Our room was throughly cleaned everyday which we really appreciated the staff is very accommodating ,1
 We were at this hotel three years ago and it was really good But this time everything has changed Breakfast is complete chaos No cups tables not clean obviously understaffed You have to ask for soap toilet paper tissues and even teabags The quality is equivalent to a two star hotel or lower We visit Vienna frequently but don t offer us this hotel again never again No Positive,0

 There was a big mirror which was facing the bed which is kind of weird Also although this is a fashion hotel it was kind of awkward to have so many plastic models in the lobby Kind of frightening at night One more thing the toilet was distance from the showering and the sink which makes it pretty inconvenient The staff in the spa section was not really friendly  The hotel was nice the staff were friendly and the breakfast was great and delicious The room was spacious and the room view was pretty good Some would say it was quite far from the city centre but there are two tram lines and I think it s fine Overall nice hotel and good staff ,1

 Went to the restaurant based on Trip Advisor recommendations and felt that the wait staff was rather snooty and not very friendly Also beds were quite hard and the pillows even though there were two different types were not very comfortable I booked this hotel because it had a pool and others did not We were looking forward to sitting by the pool while our children swam but were told we had to wait outside and could not enter without a swimsuit We did not return I also did not realize that I would be charged a different rate for each night we stayed and the price got progressively higher per night  Rooms were clean relatively large and well appointed Very nice shower and bath Great location outside of the craziness of the center but easy to get to all sights on the tram ,0

"Stayed here for - nights on business in Aug ----. It was about --- degrees everyday so plan accordingly. The rooms were nice. Big desk, chair ottoman, king size bed, bathroom on the small side but adequate. I had a view of the pool, a bbq joint and the greyhound bus station. Techinically the hotel is on the riverwalk but you really need to walk - or - blocks to get to any real action. The hotel mostly caters to business meetings and groups. I probably would not stay here on a pleasure visit because of the location. Other than the location, everything else was good. Nice staff-front desk and concierge. Rooms were nicely appointed.",0
 Unfriendly staffNo Positive,0
This trip was for a meeting for -- people. Arrangement was sent up to send a check for the meeting but the accounting department sent the wrong W- so there was a delay in the check arriving to the hotel. The front desk made the group feel horrible as if they were not going to be paid. They called our finance department and wanted either the check or a credit card. The check was on the way because they were given a date the check was issued and mailed along with the check number. That did not satify them so they charged part of the bill on a credit card and then the check arrived so they removed the charges. The break food was overcharged and bad. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
"The rooms are so far-flung it was a big hassle. We got lost going to our room. On our departure morning, it took over -- minutes and - phone calls for a bell hop to come help me with my bags.

 The house keeping came to ask the service we said no as we re checking out that morning An hour later around 10am someone just opened our door and came in for cleaning it was unbearable as we told them not to and also we checked out soon The hotel really needs to do something to connect reception and house management team so they can have info which room is checking out on the day in order to prevent disturbing the guests Also those staffs are needed to have proper training  We booked apartment with triple beds for me and my brother so it s big enough for 2 people The plan was included all minibar drinks and high speed wifi such a pleasant surprise Location was good as many stores out there on the street to shop and eat also close to West train station ,0
"For an older hotel, this Ramada was very nice. Our room was super spacious and clean! The beds were very comfortable and the noise was much less than expected for being so close to the freeway!

They were very friendly, helped us schedule transportation to/from Hanoi, provided recommendations of what to do/eat, and had great service. Also, they had delicious coffee downstairs. Overall, highly recommend this place!",1

 With so many great hotels in Paris to stay in this one is truly disappointing The concept is nice the interior decor is visually appealing and the bathrooms are nice That s pretty much where the good stops The rooms are not insulated at all bring your ear plugs the staff are too cool to be pleasant to their own guests really unwelcoming and uninterested in serving their guests there is a weird hour between 11am and 12pm where they stop serving breakfast and don t serve brunch yet which is a total bummer when you arrive at 11 01am on Sunday morning and can t get anything to eat Bottom line don t waste your time on this hotel there are so many other Parisian hotels that actually like receiving guests  The hotel decor is great The concept is cool ,0
No Negative The room was spacious,0

"This is a Hilton, so overall it is usually a nice hotel. The hotel is well located, walking distance to Fenway, the Prudential Building, the shopping mall and a lot of placed to eat. It is in front of the Sheraton that has a stop where all the duck tours and sightseeing tours stop and take people. The hotel offered free Wi-Fi on the lobby, and has a business center with computers and TV’s. They charge an additional amount of $-- for WI-FI in the room, that other cheaper hotels offer for free. There is also a Starbucks coffee bar on the lobby. The rooms are comfortable and clean, even though the bathroom is quite small for the room size, but it was clean. Overall, a very nice experience.",1

 Value of stay was good just the price for breakfast was a bit steep which is why we didn t buy it And pillows where stuffed in to cases too small for them Location to excel,0
 Nothing the air con was a little noisy and they need to replace the cheap lampshades as the plastic behind the facia of the shades are split and starting to look tatty for a 5 hotel only seen when lamps are on  The location how clean the room was thoughtful gesture off birthday cake and plate decoration in our room as was my birthday the staff member who helped with our parking on last day as was a private parking area a well run hotel Daily paper at door a nice touch no complaints Nothing about the hotel but a car park is but 3 minutes walk away and cost only 2 50 per day at weekends yes per day and 2 per hour at other times great price for central London ,1
 Wish the handle on the wall in the shower to aid in entering and leaving the shower bath were in a more useful position not behind the shower screen Boring view internal Also wish the shower was not over the bath but this is true of most hotels in the UK form what I ve seen  Excellent wifi good bed close to underground buses and Hopon Hopoff bus route ,1

The building is beautiful OUTSIDE...white carrara marble... super nice... Rooms are cool and spacious and the tub is cool! Staff is nice EXCEPT the beyond RUDE puerto rican jersey shore looking bold bar tender at the rooftop. He totally does NOT belong working in hospitality at all! He should not have contact with people! A total disappointing experience. He got offended because he made me a WRONG gimlet! He was super rude when I mentioned to him he had made a mistake on the ingredients of my drink; He thew the drink in a terrible RUDE manner! Extremely Beyond description inappropriate! 
The hotel is totally different from the Standard in Miami Beach... TOTALLY.... but it is still in a great location, ok priced and the rooms are nice. Just be careful with the rude rooftop staff.",0
 I was disappointed with the standard of the rooms They were run down and fairly shabby Definitely not worth the money  The location was very good,0
 If you travel from the USA the rooms are not ready early and no space to rely If a room is ready by 10 they would charge you an extra day That s want the front desk told me While waiting in the lobby sometimes you had water sometimes not If no water don t ask they refused my wife for a glass of water  The location only but it was so noisy in the street that I would not recommend the hotel if you get a street room,0

 Nothing Everything,1
 We had already paid for breakfast to be included in the price of the room but then had to pay again to have the cooked breakfast Although it was excellent I felt a little irritated that I had paid twice also proper coffee would have improved this situation  Quirky building very comfortable The staff were amazing very polite and friendly and cheerful The breakfast is the best Full English breakfast I have ever had ,1

 The location there was allready one open water bottle in the mini bar when i came and the lobby staff respond was okay do you want me to change it for you it is okay becouse it is free we wont charge you for it  The only thing I can think about this hotel that is good is that the mini bar is free but there is only soda water,0
 The only thing bad I can say is I ordered breakfast to my room and the coffee portion was tiny I would of liked an option of a big pot I need this to wake up  Staff were very welcoming and nothing asked requested was to much much trouble Rooms were spotless Bedding looked new I usually hate staying in hotel beds but it was spotless so I was fine Ordered breakfast in my room They made the porridge with soya as requested and the bowl was huge gorgeous and filling Car park is UCP which is a two minute walk away ,1

"Tried Priceline, asking for a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""FOUR STAR HOTEL in or near downtown LA"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" -- and got the room for the requested $----night. 
That's the good part. The hotel is tired, confusing, and food and parking are very expensive. The room is tiny, windows don't open, and our request for non-smoking was ignored, as the room clearly had smoke odors... 
Certainly not deserving of FOUR STARS.. 
View is okay, mostly buildings, though you can do better, elsewhere.

 Cold room no hot water for a dayNo Positive,0
 Very tired and dated property in a grand building From the dirty wood behind reception to the scruffy false grass in the courtyard and corridors that smelt like an old one star hotel The glass tables in the old fashioned restaurant are so scratched they should have been replaced years ago But I suppose for a Vendome hotel the price is towards the lower end  Location,0

 They didn t have a double room available for me at 14 00 and they said through booking com they don t receive these information So I waited about 1hr for the room to be ready The facilities in the bedroom is probably the oldest I have every seen Bath I didn t even want to try Toilet didn t have a proper door to close and you know the consequences In the room you don t even have some water to drink now alcohol or anything not even a tooth paste The breakfast is a simple english breakfast and they wait until something is finished completely and then after at least 10 minutes somebody will realise and refill Overal it should be a 1 start hotel in my opinion will never go anywhere close it again  The location is great ,0

Rooms are decent size and clean. Like the location - union sq is a neat place - although not as convenient to other spots in the city depending on where you are going. Was woken up both nights I was there by loud customers in the room next door (walls must be thin) and I am a good sleeper with ear plugs.,0
 Temperature in the building Guests should have the option change temperature I just now have a sore throat because of this  Very nice hotel beautiful view with pool 1 issue was the temperature the whole building is set up to 21 C but I was feeling cold and could not change the temperature Otherwise nice hotel ,0
 The standard room is very small for a Mercure brand I have to change to a privilege room Room rates was more expensive than what is being advertised Limited facilities and housekeeping did not replenish mini bar even though it comes with minibar when you pay for privilege room Did not hang up bathrobe when I leave it on the sofa  N A,0

 Upsold to a Corner Room described as having great views Room was in a corner of a corridor not building with view of cars parked in street asked to change and they admitted they had no other rooms even the one I have previously reserved they were clearly overbooking to make the most of the season The Airconditioning heating in room was not working December or the phone my Girlfriend Birthday Weekend in London did not appreciate the workmen and ladder in room whilst she was getting dressed All in all a huge disappointment for the price was a regular client not any more sadly Beware and don t trust the desk staff if they try to sell you a better room likely it will not be  Great Location third visit to this Hotel in the past it has been great ,0

 The AC in our room did not work properly It was super hot at night time Feels like in a sauna We could not sleep well We did not enjoy our 3 nights stay because of that We tried to tell the management on the 1st night but they said there s nothing they could do We didn t open any window because the receptionist said the AC won t work well if the window were open Hoping that the AC will work apparently it s not  We love the breakfast The best part about this hotel is the breakfast Wonderful staff and great food to start your day in Vienna ,0

 The hotel restaurant food was minimal except for breakfast which was good as in if you are travelling with young kids and hope to get a snack during the evening after a tired day out then that s not possible  The staff were extremely cordial and helpful The location of the hotel had adequate transport to get to the center Catalunya Its close to the beach and McD s is one bus stop ,1
 Overall we didn t feel the same 5 service as we have come to expect from staying at other marriot hotels We were also very surprised be charged 10 pounds for one day on the wifi  The location was wonderful ,0
 Having to walk up two flights of stairs with our cases because the lift was broken the heating in the room didn t work and when we reported it the reply was oh thanks for letting us know and only white bread poor continental breakfast to make toast with at breakfast time And when we showed our room key we were told we d already been marked off as having eaten Trust me we wouldn t have bothered eating it twice  The location was perfect,0

 The breakfast room was abominable at 7 15 am the room was drowned in a very loud and unbearable muzak of no musical or other value The staff were allegedly unable to turn the volume down or shut it as the controls were in the basement and they had to wait for 8 am for the manager to arrive at 8 am nothing happened though It ruined the breakfast and was so unpleasant I recommend avoiding this hotel and will personally never return there  The breakfast was very good gastronomically unfortunately the muzak was so loud it was impossible to enjoy it The bed was very comfortable ,0

 Very small room So tiny wall mounted lights and TV were dangerous head bumping Gym is well equipped but very small Reception helpful,0
 The ground floor room G5 was pokey and oddly shaped and facing on to Gower St at ground level it was really noisy The UCL Hospital is just up the road and while it is comforting to be close to such a centre of excellence the noise and frequency of emergency ambulances going past was a bummer  The location was ideal for the 3 things we wanted to do on the trip The shower in the room was excellent and the breakfast was among the best we have had in a London hotel ,1

 We made a booking for two double rooms online We checked in at different times First room was very basic Queen guest room and we were offered an upgrade for 50 pppn which we declined Second room was very nice King executive room but it was given to us automatically for no extra cost Why the double standards  The welcome cookie was a nice touch and there were ice machines on a number of floors You got a 5 voucher if you requested no housekeeping the next day In addition the Sky Terrace offers fantastic views and the hotel s location is within short walking distance of the City many tourist attractions and the Tower Hill tube station ,1

 Breakfast taken in restaurant staff not at all helpful or pleasant particularly as I explained we were in a hurry left to fend for ourselves no service given and they had the cheek to charge 12 5 service charge on a bill of 75 00 for some tea and toast for 4 people When leaving I did say that I did not wish to pay the service charge but it was still included on my room bill Lift from pavement into hotel usually not working very difficult with My elderly mother in wheelchair and grandchildren in prams Would not stay there again Reception staff friendly and helpful Disabled bathroom good ,0
 The price charged for the room because it was the night of the Billy Joel concert was extortionate I appreciate I have a choice to book but my expectations were greater than the room that I was given I usually stay in the Hilton which I much prefer and feel that it is worth the money but unfortunately it was sold out the minute I had booked the tickets on the day of release The standard of the room for the price paid executive room was disproportionate but appreciate that when in demand they can charge what they like  The location is obviously great for Wembley the room was clean breakfast good and the staff were very nice ,1
 Had to wait for 30 40 minutes at 4 00 pm after arrival for check in as room was not ready Everything I love this property people,1
 The air conditioning is not very effective and the bed sheets and towels should be replaced Improving this would make Exe a wonderful place  Breakfast was great and considering the heat in Vienna the swimming pool was a great advantage ,1
 Very poor internet staff not interested in the guests noisy next to highway lifts broken and slow Room was clean and the bathroom big,0
 We did not have electricity for a night temps were sub zero due to unscheduled maintenance Room isolation was poor door of neighbor very loudly heard and can hear neighbor conversation Room was too small good location in proximity to Arc and Champs Elysse Comfortable bed Hotel concerned with safety door locked after 1 and need reception to open it,0

"We were looking forward to our stay after reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked a deluxe room and on arrival we were shown a room with peeling wallpaper, marked skirting boards.
After pointing out the description of a deluxe room to the Manager we were offered another room which initially seemed fine.
However the view was of a department store roof & service yard. There seem to be some sort of electrical engine running somewhere below our room, which could be heard throughout the night. On the final morning we were woken at -:--am by the waste disposal truck. When using the shower the whole room vibrated! No tea or coffee facilities in the room, it is available in the hotel lobby in the morning.
On a positive note the staff were very friendly and the location was good.",0
 We were put in the first floor overlooking a main road so we couldn t have our curtains open because cars were so close Got very little sleep all night because of the traffic right outside our window and emergency service sirens It was so loud it sounded like the windows were open There was also no iron in the room water was an additional cost and there were no plug sockets near any mirrors No English tv channels Breakfast was very average Not a great experience for the price paid could ve had much better elsewhere for less They also make out the hotel is much more central than it actually is Definitely couldn t have stayed for more than 1 night  Location was okay Bathroom was nice Staff were very nice ,0

No Negative The location of this hotel is what you are paying for and it is EXCELLENT You are a block from Musee D Orsay which means a block from the Metro and the hop on hop off buses and other public transport Cafes are nearby and it s easy to walk to all the major sites in that area So that s reason 1 to stay there The rest of the reasons are easy too friendly staff speaks a number of languages good bar and cafe on site rooms are small but creatively decorated and absolutely comfortable and cozy No amenity other than extra space is overlooked There is a small elevator lift ,1
"We stayed here June -th and -th,room was reasonable size and seemed clean. The view was over city skyline - unless you looked down in which case it was rooftops and air con compressors. Small balcony was a bit dirty. The location was good for our needs, a bit of a walk to the main Riverwalk bars etc but it meant the area was less noisy. The only comment was that the staff we encountered in the corridors-lifts were surly to the point of being rude. A smile costs nothing and makes a guest feel welcome.",0
No Negative The Asia De Cuba Restaurant was fantastic Service and food both top notch The late bar was very classy hidden away so feels secluded The room decor was very modern and comfortable to stay in The staff were very friendly and accommodating The location in terms of locality to Trafalgar Square Covent Garden Embankment The Strand and Leicester Square was great ,1
 location is not very convenient I can t believe this is a four star hotel wifi is bad The wooden floor has too much shrinkage which hurt my toe and separate the nail and toe elevator is not working breakfast is not as fantastic as the photo shown curtain of the window is falling down staff is nice,0
 The free breakfast selection was very limited anything substantial and cooked was to cost more The main lift was out of order the alternative service lift looked dirty and dodgy The air conditioner started leaking water into the room on the last day Staff informed that all the rooms have this problem due to the inclination of some pipe I fail to understand why such a not so cheap hotel is unable to install the air conditioning system correctly Would have given a better rating on the cleanliness otherwise  Comfortable and spacious room and bed though I was upgraded to a nicer room Convenient location minutes away from the City ,1
 t is a very big And crowded hotel You are like walking in a neighbourhood in the reception  Location standart Hilton quality ,0
 Bedroom was too warm and air conditioning unit ineffective Hallway was also like a sauna  Great service and amenities and very near to oxford street,1

 The wifi is almost non existent in this hotel and drops out every ten minutes forcing you to go the whole log in process again Very disappointing No Positive,0
 You have to go down a few steps in our room to get to the bathroom Ok if you are fit and able but may prove a bit difficult for people with mobility issues  This is a conveniently located hotel for central London It is competitively priced with a very good selection of cafes for breakfast within 2mins of the front door Rooms have complementary bottles of water and plenty of tea and coffee ,1

 The beds were so hard it was like sleeping on a cement slab My room was not cleaned properly either and no towels were replaced gor me it was the location Right near moulin rouge and the hop on hop off bus,0
 room needed upgrading Breakfast superb,1
 With the basin right behind the beds and a separate toilet chamber without any wash basin a tad odd for someone used to a large integrated bathroom But this is minor on service cleanliness and staff no issues at all would definitely stay here again  Great location steps away from St Stephens cathedral and host of nice restaurants close by Warm and helpful staff Room was spotleess and reasonably spacious by European standards Not much street noise Nice breakfast service with eggs to order and cheese meats and the works A pleasant experience overall ,1
No Negative the friendliness of the staff and the sky lounge,1

 i dont like how the hotel receptionist handled my concern first night i requested for a dental kit or tooth paste as we have our own toothbrushes with us but they couldnt help at all Next day I bought my own toothpaste from the supermarket so i can brush my teeth after a long walk to see the rest of the attractions when i came back our room was cleaned but our toothbrushes were gone and no one can help us again very inconvenient and horrible experienced in a four star hotel like this  I like the location it is a little close to some famous attractions ,0

 Staff was lukewarm and questionable I ve caught them lie to me on more than one occasion as well as ignore some of my requests The room was not as nice as the pictures and looked dated  The location is in the middle of everything downtown Easy to get to the nearby attractions and metro is across the street if you want to take the public transportation ,0

No Negative Fabulously helpful staff ,1
 In the morning we had to wait a while to get some breakfast due to fact that there weren t enough space for all residentsNo Positive,1
 The spa is very basic but we were not in Paris to visit a spa  Arguably the best position in Paris in terms of accessibility to so many historic places and good bars and restaurants even if there are also some rather tacky looking touristy eateries in the vicinity The tone of the hotel was generally civilised and peaceful ,1
 Breakfast selection could have been better but the food was good  The location was good ,1

No Negative Excellent location Great Wifi access Breakfast had everything including freshly squeezed orange juice Rooms were a bit out dated but comfy ,1
 Nothing Restaurant Delicious and wonderful food,1
 No one informed us that there were works carried out in the lobby which looked like a building site The bathrooms are very tired with old taps and mouldy corners on the bathroom Details of bathroom and bedroom are pretty average Overall it is a four star hotel and not a five star as advertised on the internet  The location was definitely the bonus of the hotel The use of Hermes toiletries is also showing the effort of the hotel to make up for its faults ,0
 Bathroom was scruffy with a patched up bath  The location and the friendly staff Lovely bed linen ,0
 Cleanliness They didn t clean the used coffee cups from previous guest  Very nice interior design of the hotel Very convenient location and safe neighborhood ,0
 Lack of choice and value meal wise though hotel is happy for you to order in to eat in room  The tram being nearby rooms were quiet and clean Friendly staff ,1
 We had two rooms for a family of four but only one electric kettle and two tea cups We got another two cups on request but every day the room mate took them away so we had to ask for them every day again No Positive,1
 Better onboarding by hotel staff to explain basics would ve gone a long way to being better orientated to and inside the room I took me time to find my room location wasn t intuitive and this could ve been better explained The cleanliness of the room was not up to standard The floor was dusty and there was only half a roll of toilet paper loaded in the bathroom The worst thing for me was not being able to turn off the A C only to find out later that there was a separate lever to do this that was not explained  Location room size decent pricing ,0
 Very old and dated rooms not very modern very very dated and rooms without window not completely clean Staff didn t seem to know what to do when dealing with my complain about the room we had t change rooms and the room we were given was dirty tiny and bathroom dirty Close to tube station,0
 My room was located in a dungeon like setting in the underground level of the external rear of the building within a group of independent little blocks A permanent and loud noise from some conditioned air machine I supposed ruined my sleep It felt like I was on a cruise On top of that the room had wide windows and apart the feeling of lack of privacy the curtains were not sufficient to retain artificial light to come in at night Overall I did not feel comfortable The Wi Fi signal was really bad absent in my morlock room Breakfast was served in a different building across the square but once there no signs lead the way No Positive,0
 Room was small and bed was hard and lumpy Location was good and staff were friendly,0
 The hotel is a bit far from the centre but still can be reached by taking a tram 12 and then 13 The only thing that such a good hotel should have an airport shuttle Bed hotel atmosphere bar staff bathroom and room size ,0
No Negative All staff were kind and supportive ,1
 There was never any spaces in the car park We were attending a wedding in the hotel the tables had named places but staff would not make sure that people were sitting in the right place We had nowhere to sit due to incompetence and ended up leaving to have our meal elsewhere there were six of us in the party one of us being the father of the bride We did not return to the wedding reception as the whole thing was farcical  Breakfast,0
 Having to leave and go home  Staff was attentive professional and always courteous,1
 The morning coffee was slow to appear and our room was cleaned even when we had the do not disturb sign on the door and had told two people that we did not need it cleaned The staff were brilliant very friendly and always happy to help The location was perfect for what we wanted a short walk away from theatres shops restraunts and the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland,1

 Nothing The hotel was wonderful clean and modern Staff very polite and friendly Would definately stay again ,1
 Small room Excellent location Paddington station clean but very small room friendly staff,1
 The decor was a bit shabby and very dis organised at breakfast the food ran out and guests were kept waiting only one member of staff working front of house which wasn t very good when trying to locate cutlery etc  The Staff were lovely helpful and friendly,0
 Poor airconditioning at the older property though the Manager took pains to try and make amends which we appreciate No Positive,0
 The reception staff were very cold and not particularly welcoming They were better once we checked out as they were different employees but the welcome was not warm at all and they didn t even ask how we were They forgot milk with our tea and coffee arrangement so I had to call about them bringing some up and then they took 20 minutes to do so and therefore we only had two sips of tea before we checked out of the room the next day If I m paying 100 I expect a decent cup of tea in the morning The bed dipped in the middle slightly so my partner and I felt like we were falling into each other  The bathroom was stunning very well put together and the facilities like the TV and the design of the room were very nice ,0
 The bed was not big enough for a couple and was not comfortableNo Positive,0

 I asked for a twin room but got a double bed room and as I was with my 33 year old daughter it wasn t really appropriate plus the room was tiny for 2 people All was average,0
No Negative Room was perfect Large comfortable Clean The bathroom was large and comfortable All what you can expect from a good hotel The Hosts were very helpful and very kind Breakfast was huge The value for money was great The Hotel is 20 minutes walk from Duomo Milan Center Check out was 12 00 and this is a Huge Plus ,1
 Nothing Bed big comfy shower awesome location great top class hotel definitely will return ,1
 The heating was stuck on in room and someone had to fix it and asked for upper floor and got put in basement instead  When booking the room it was a deluxe double and the picture showed you the room to be bigger with a sofa and a bath in the bathroom to which partner wanted a nice soak cause don t get time at home with young child online it says rooms have a iron and ironing board to which it didn t,0
 Bathroom was flooding no free water no toothbrush set Staff are friendly,0
 Because we had a late check in they put us in a basic room instead of a twin room for what we paid extra The worst is that they insisted that it is a twin room The problem is that the twin room is almost double the size of the basic room and cannot be mistaken And because there were some strange noises coming from the pipes of the AC we demanded to be moved and on the next day we finally got our twin room Next time don t try to lie The shower in both rooms was not working very fluently There is no full size mirror in the room And generally the pictures shown are lying about the room size The rooms are smaller than they look  Location is good Wi Fi signal is good ,0
No Negative Staff were simply great Pay the extra and get a club room though ,1

 Decor a bit tatty Hotel across three buildings and room quality seems to vary a lot Lots of up and down stairs with bags to get to reception and then room Noise carried from other rooms Breakfast mediocre Location good Area comparable to Chelsea in London Quiet area and lovely to walk around Easy to get into centre by tram,0
 No comment  WOW The main lobby and reception area looks Gergian Victorian and Edwardian style Good location for everything very close to the Bayswater Queens Underground Train Station and walking distance to Paddington Train Station Lots of restaurants to choose very near also close to Hyde Park that you can relate with the nature and get some fresh air The place is quiete and peaceful and very relax at Room 115 The staffs are friendly and helpful The buffet breakfast was excellent I had a healthy breakfast option This four star hotel is highly recommended Well done keep it up the excellent service folks ,1
No Negative Lovely hotel near everything the staff were very welcoming and couldn t do more for us during our stay,1
 Bed was not that comfortable Staff were helpful and friendly,1
"Lately I have been very careful of where I stay since hotels have become very complacent with their guests. Cutting corners and not caring about customer service. But this hotel was #-, very clean for the price which was VERY VERY reasonable for Los Angeles. I would definitely stay there again until they start to disappoint me like others.",1
 the rooms are not sound proof you can hear everyone around you after certain hours at night you won t find a person to help you with your staff  Location,0
 Nothing it s perfect  Location Very polite and professional staff Clean rooms with a nice shower,1
 The check in was chaos as was the check out we had to wait in the bar for over an hour to wait for our room to be ready and had to queue for 45 minutes to check out to make things worse the hotel as tried to take the payment twice from my bank account I have been staying at this Hotel for over 30 year s but I think after the changeover to Holiday Inn I ll be making other arrangements for my next stay in London No Positive,1
 I don t know if it was the sale price that gave me such a disappointing room But room 697 is the worst 4 star hotel room I have ever been to If I knew that room was going to be ready for me I wouldn t have booked Location location and location,0
 Room small and claustrophobic There definitely should be a warning highlighting the step into the very small ensuite as it is a hazard For a small hotel the receptionist was not very welcoming on arrival Wine which had never been requested nor consumed was added to our bill at the end for some reason However this was immediately removed on pointing out the error Continental breakfast was adequate No Positive,0

 Cleaning old rooms Breakfast,0
 Noisy trains could not sleep could not change room Very poor internet service THis was particularly frustrating as nobody seemed to know how to resolve this and I eventually had to go to a local cafe Nero to access internet and conduct business Despite putting in several complaints nobody seemed bothered to find a solution following the first attempt Room service poor quality aged towels dusty wardrobe iron not worth using as it took 20 minutes to iron a business shirt The only positive about my stay is that the breakfast staff were absolutely wonderful  Location,0
 Rooms are a bit too tight Location is somewhat isolated and far from downtown amsterdam  Comfortable bed Cozy rooms Location was close to a tram stop ,1
 Only minor details was not a fan of the cedarwood scented bath products and the fancy stone flooring in the bathroom meant the toilet seat was freezing  Wonderful room cosy nice bathroom and bathtub nespresso machine great location within walking distance of Buckingham Palace Big Ben and the Westminster area ,1
 Breakfast was expensive as was room service Rooms felt a little snug and didn t have much room Decor was great staff were very friendly,1

 The lift for some reason is in the middle of the staircase What a crazy idiotic design Had to drag suitcase up and down the staircase  Staff was friendly and helpful,0
 The desk staff had difficulty explaining some charges and procedures though we were able to piece things together after consultation Hotel staff were uncertain about the status of our reservation when we checked in having difficulty in calling up our reservation so I wondered about the quality of communication between the hotel and Booking com We eventually learned that the rooms were held under my colleague s name despite the fact that she had not actually made the booking  The room was quite clean and the little touches including cookies cold water ample supplies of tea and coffee were much appreciated The staff in the restaurants were excellent extremely welcoming and able to comment on the menu selections ,1

"Great location at a budget. There is a particular odour in the room that I m not comfortable with. -st night i was there, the shower was not working. Other than location and price, there is nothing great about the place. If you are looking for a nicer place, find elsewhere.",0
 The staff are not that experienced in the better restaurants so best to make your own or make sure they understand exactly what you are looking for in dining  Great location Close to Plaza Catalunya Walk everywhere but the Metro and buses are nearby We had an outdoor area with a hot tub Quite nice Great breakfast Very comfortable and an all around good value ,1
 I didn t like the fact that they took the full amount in pound out of our account twice on departure Then we had to wait 6 days to get it back Then the blame game started with them saying it was my bank holding the money We should never have been charged twice in the first place I know who was left out of pocket and it wasn t them No Positive,0
 rooms very sparse no chairs on balcony only 1 bedside cabinet 1 straight back chair 1 arm chair no umbrellas or sun shade around the pool  Near railway station ,0
 The staff was unconcerned to the extent rude and not even wanting to listen and was argumentative type We had booked for 3 persons in a room and they charged over and above the rate we had paid and didn t listen to our submissions that we have already booked for 3 persons and paid at the time of booking and were not willing to listen and solve problem and no Manager was willing to come and talk and they really overcharged us There were no greetings by any staff member to any resident at any time and they showed a non concerned approach Except for the location there is nothing good in the hotel and next time we are not going to try any Mercure Hotel any where in the world Nothing except its location,0
 The lady at check in desk Sarah when I asked for a spare key for my room assumed it was for a gentleman she said I will leave the key downstairs for your gentleman friend when it was for my friend who is a woman I felt it was disrespectful making assumptions that women that come to hotels are booking for gentleman friends 2 The carpets were not very clean in the room  The location,0

 Rooms were very noisy we could loudly hear the traffic outside our neighbors and when someone was walking upstairs The first family room we had 340 was very run down the next room we got 339 was slightly better but still very dated The shower barely worked in our first room The carpets were dirty The outside of the hotel as well as the reception looks very nice But once inside the corridors and the rooms everything is very run downed and dated This hotel is in dire need of a complete makeover I guess this is a very typical Victorian London Hotel  Clean sheets good location and good price ,0

"My sister and I stayed here over this Columbus Day weekend. We loved the location as it was just --- blocks from our brother's apt. We are walkers and walked everywhere - even all the way to Greenwich Village. 
The staff was without doubt the nicest, friendliest and most helpful I have ever encountered and I used to work in the hotel industry. Stalin at the door was wonderful! It was great to be greeted with smiles from the doormen and front desk no matter what time of day we entered.
My only beef is that I made the reservation months ago and specifically asked for an upper floor to avoid street noise and was given a room on the -th which was not high enough. Seeing other reviews it looks as if I should have insisted on another room but other than that, the stay was great.",1
 I booked this hotel because booking com advertised childcare babysitting This was not the case and I was left with no options for my husbands birthday party which we had booked nearby We travelled from Australia for the occasion and the staff seemed unconcerned Even when I insisted on an interconnecting room so we could be close to our children this all seemed too much effort Staff really lack any personal skills The nearby hotels offer babysitting and this could ve been suggested to assist Rooms are pretty average Double bed very small Only 1 child can be accommodated hence having to book 2 rooms  The location is great behind kensington high street Perfect for exploring and having shops restaurants nearby ,0
 intrusive and disorganised check in was incompetentNo Positive,0
 Hotel cleaning that started on Sunday around 9am was very noisy it was impossible to have a slow relaxing start of the day  Very friendly staff excellent location comfortable room adequate to the price though ,1
 The air conditioning in our room was exceedingly noisy so much that we decided to switch it off and sleep with an open window Not a huge discomfort but not adequate for a hotel of this level had we stayed longer or in a hotter period I would definitely have complained to the staff  We were in London for a city break and the hotel s position was perfect 200 metres from Tower Hill 50 from the underground station Room furniture cleanliness and services are what you should expect from a five star structure The swimming pool is a big plus if you are staying for more days Price adequate to the level and position of the hotel ,1
 Verse Noisy in bar due to rugby being shown on tv  Breakfast excellent Room comfortable ,1
 Very old and uncomfortably room and bathroom Uncomfortable mattress blanket instead of commonly used white Duvet Not very good isolation on the 6th floor rooftop and no adjustable heating or air conditioning  Excelent location On a calm street 10 mins walking distance from the arc de Triomphe champs Elys es and airport buses Etoile Porte Maillot Very nice and attentive staff Exent detail of having an adroid for guests to use during the stay The android has wifi useful apps inc google maps and free calls for selected countries Guests can carry it around the city and charge it on the room Good value for money ,1
 The free wifi didn t work at all in the room and not good in the hallway The staff was very nice and willing to help,1
 I hated just about every bit of my stay i ended up checking out a day early because i couldn t put up with feeling like sub human scum thanks to the staff of the hotel Being 24 i got treated like a homeless person off the street I work incredibly hard and run two businesses and every day i got back to the hotel i was made to feel like a was some peasant off the street Shocking hotel was even asked when checking in if i could afford the stay i have shoes worth more than the checkin boy earns a month how dare he question my ability to pay  Nothing it was shockingly bad the staff are some of the rudest i have ever come across ,0

 The room was really small We had 2 big luggages which couldn t go through the area beyond the bed and they had to be placed right outside the toilet which obstructed the walkway The room we stayed in had no toiletries like toothbrush and other stuff like bedroom slippers so if you need them you have to request from housekeeping  Bed was really comfortable I slept very well during my 4 nights there Breakfast was a very simple spread but good enough Room was clean ,1
 I ve got a terrible room It was smelled from the sewer Room was under the roof and I was not able to sleep because of some sounds from the roof sewer during the night It was very audible and so annoying  The receptionist and overall the staff was very helpful and kind ,0
 I was wrongly informed by staff about breakfast charges and ended up being overcharged The staff in the restaurant was not very attentive and quite rude  The location is great for visiting London sights ,0
 Was never told there was construction wouldn t have gone at all I payed extra on the day to upgrade our room but even on the tenth floor all you could hear was banging asked if thestaff could move us to a room further away from construction and they didn t reply to it Finished at 7pm and started again at 8am in the morning The bath was dirty and the layout of the actuall room was terrible I wouldn t stay here again or recommend Wasn t asked how my stay was and the check out was terrible the gentleman just didn t want to know  Upgrade to a room with a view bath room was a nice lay out,0
 The bed was uncomfortable PR at reception and waiting time need tremendous improvement  The location is fairly good ,1
 Asked for a double room but got a twin  A great value room Not glamorous but did a job and was in a good location,1
 Unbelievably my husband arrived before me and was unable to check in as the booking was in my name He gave them my mobile number and they still did not want to let him check in even when he offered to pay again so they could reimburse later as he needed to get ready for our night out and I would only be going to the hotel much later He had to call a a manager Very unimpressed as never had this problem at other hotels Then 9am there was knocking on the door only for staff to use their key for entry We we re only staying the one night so no need for staff to be entering the room Won t stay again  Great location and bed was good,0
 nothing everything was perfect the mini bar prices were too high so we didn t use anything  We liked the kettle and tea making facilities in the room and the very large bed very helpful staff printed tickets etc and recommended restaurants lots of extra bits and pieces provided free in the bathroom fridge was handy powerful shower over the bath,1

"Stayed at this hotel for my friends --th. Very average hotel. Rooms very very clean and house keeping were brilliant.
While we were there for - nights the escalators didnt work upto the lobby area and there was only one lift working which meant having to queue everytime you went back intoa hotel.
Staff very friendly
Slightly noisey as we looked over times square but a great view.
Dont go for the swimming pool, its nothing like the photos ! VERY AVERAGE",0
 Internet connection Needed a strap hook to keep the ironing board locked in the wardrobe  Cosy room at the top Breakfast Pleasant and helpful staff ,1
"Great hotel in the center of the city pretty , great rooms, right in the middle of everything expensive but worth it.",1
 furniture and premises in need of a bit of renewal great location comfortable in general the lobby and bar area a good addition in paris size of room acceptable breakfast area and food very decent ,1
 Room and sink size was smaller but that s not that big of a deal  They have a delicious express breakfast for 4 Euros that offers a sandwich juice and coffee or tea ,1
 ALL NOTHING,0
 I paid in advance at least 2 month ago to get an room with excellent view when I arrived gave ne a room in the first floor with view to lateral street I spoke in the front desk and change me the room with train station view excellent  Near from the Train Station,1

 Hotel very shabby and dated Noise from trains until late was unbearable Drinks very expensive for the standard of hotel Tea and coffee at breakfast was not very good at all Beds were tiny and not very comfortable  Staff were pleasant breakfast was reasonable ,0
 The quilts on the beds were really big for a single bed younger children would struggle with the weight Also no instructions with the cooking appliances which I figured out but perhaps a non English person might struggle Loved the heated bathroom mirror Loved the facilities have a fridge etc ,1
 Nothing The hotel was really clean and our room was spacious The location is superb very close to the opera and St Stephen s To note also that the breakfast was really delicious ,1
 Sky bar no staff Bed,0
 The drab lighting hall ways are dark the breakfast place looks like a bombed out building basement it make me angry to see such a beautiful stucture not at least with good lighting glaring lights came from the floor in the breakfast room or no light in other places some CEO should be fired  The owners should spend money on lighting painting decorating it isn t fair to the fine staff that work there ,0
 See above  Bed was good but there should have been a frying pan in addition to the two small pans available One pan was discraisful and should have been changed Room size was good ,0

Very clean and fitted out well.
Great spot. Great location.",1
 The first mornings breakfast service can only be descried as shambolic every order of a party of four either had elements missing or unwanted additions added A word with reception sorted it out the next day however it really shouldn t need a word  The hotel is part of a much larger hotel situated across the road I actually thought that is the hotel I had booked It turns out we had booked into an annex of the main hotel and as such was a bit lacking in facility but still very comfortable ,1
No Negative Fantastic staff fun hotel ,1
 They should change the damaged loo seat for a new one No Positive,1

 The staff from the reception where very unprofesional The room I first received had a broken bed  The location,1
No Negative Great central location Staff were really friendly and helpful,1
 On the other hand if you take out the location factor This hotel is not even qualified to be called as 2 star for some reason this was a 4 star hotel maybe the paris standards The breakfast was such a disappointment the rooms were so cramped Junior Suite was a joke played on us The whole facility looked like sham  The only best thing about this hotel and all the central hotels in paris is the location and proximity to all things interesting ,0
 cleanliness of the toilet staff and people at the hotel comfortable bed good breakfest,1
 Check in staff maid service and room Location most sites are 20 mins walk,0

 Says 15min tram time from the centre of Amsterdam but we took tram bus and metro and they all took about 30 mins not 15 Wasn t too bad as all the stops are about 5 min walk from the hotel  Lovely hotel staff are very helpful rooms are all of a high standard bathrooms clean Has speakers in the bathroom smart tv free wifi Couldn t of asked for better value for money Had a lovely stay ,1
No Negative Loved this hotel It was spotless beautifully decorated Staff were lovely The room backed onto a tiny courtyard there were better views if you had a room looking over the canal but our room was silent at all times and the bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in Highly recommend ,1
 Old tired room that was expensive Unresponsive to email prior to my stay Recieved a 100 car parking fine for a car I didn t park Despite asking recieved no help moving 6 boxes and a case from the business centre to my car which included steps  Helpful door staff on arrival unpacked my car and put equipment for conference into storage then into my conference room ,0
"From the time we checked in, until a hotel staff member hailed a cab for us at our time of departure, we loved the Mela. The staff members were pleasant and accomodating. Our very clean room and bathroom were more spacious than we expected. The bed was very comfortable, with great pillows and a fluffy comforter. Excellent location for walking to many destinations in Manhattan. You will love the quiet, elegant atmosphere of the Mela.",1
 Not convinced of the open plan bathroom and the lighting seemed overly complicated  Location superb,1
"I picked this hotel thinking it's part of the Hilton family, so it will be nice. The first thing I was told when checkign in is that there's breakfast for $--.-- per person! When we went to breaksfast...the bread was stale and hard, the eggs did not come the way I ordered them, the fruit was not fresh, and the strawberried had MOLD on them!! And when I told the staff, she didn't even apologize. Also, the rooms are not sound proof at all!! I heard everything people were saying in the rooms next to me....and at some point at night there was someone banging on the door next to my room! The hotel however is situated in a nice area, close to everything, aquarium, shops, etc.",0

 Option for premium Wifi for 6 euros per 24 hoursNo Positive,1
 The rooms do not look good the furniture is old and damaged the sofa was ratty with pieces falling off it there was dust on the floors the bathroom is outdated and with a dirty apearance The halls the elevator and the entrance to the section where we were accomodated are ugly and dirty The access to the hotel is made through a passage that is dirty and noisy the steps to the hotel were always full of snipes and garbage  The room has a good size and we were able to accomodate all our things given that we travelled with our 11 month old boy and the location ia good ,0
 Room was lovely but the shower needed maintenance  Very good value for money in London and super convenient location Friendly staff ,1
 Parking  Very good choice for that money ,1
 Queuing for breakfast Location great staff helpful room comfy and public rooms very god ,1
 The room was dirty with hair all over Minibar was a small basket and not a fridge Really expensive It s cheaper to order the drinks and snacks from other country The hotel location is great,0
 My biggest disappointment was the steam sauna which was nearly cold and stank like a pile of rotting wet towels Entering there would mean asking for a nasty fungal infection It also took me by surprise that the wellness Ruheraum chillout room was very very cold on some days you are probably supposed to lie down in your winter jacket right out of sauna There is also too much light This area has great potential to become an attractive wellnes center too bad it seems that nobody cares  The hotel is overall nice feels bit impersonal ok rooms and above average breakfast I HIGHLY appreciate that the hotel GYM has at least basic free weight dumbell set adjustable gym bench and gym mats which allows for a basic workout Also the finnish sauna is good provides some relax after long working day ,0
 I choose with breakfast but then we had to pay for it and breakfast wasnt good at all Room size was good but we booked jacoozy room but it wasn t working,0

 Prearranged for a bottle of wine to be in our room on arrival wasn t there which was very disappointing and never showed up  Modern tech nature of the room,0
 This hotel is not 4 star Classic rooms are extremely shabby Cigarete burns in carpet faded and chipped furniture Towels are thin threadbare and had holes in them Told us this is because the room is due for renovation No cups or milk in room Insufficient tea and coffee Location is terrible in an industrial area 15 mins by train out of the city nothing is in walking distance No cafes or shops close by On checkin they tried to charge us for city taxes even though we had prepaid these on booking Tried to get us to pay an extra 40 per night for their renovated rooms on check in A stay closer in town is better value for money than this poorly located shabby 4 star hotel So dissapointing  The bed was ok ,0
 room service food inedible room had nasty smell forced to upgrade as booked room not ready when arrived at 15 30 extra 40 euros for nothing,0

"It's perfectly located right on the Riverwalk and in terms of its location in the heart of San Antonio. The bed was really heavenly - maybe new mattresses. A little more space in the room would always be nice. 
We used the gym two days and it's a fairly nice set up. Clean and brightly lit with plenty of equipment.",1
 the floor is too noisy heaters were off location,0
"I travel roughly --% of the time, and stay in hotels from awful to - star. The Royalton's - stars are fully earned. To address the negative things I've read; yes, the place is dimly lit. It's intentional. We liked it. The service was always attentive and friendly. The lobby is very atmospheric, and, for sure, the place is edgy. The elevators are small, but nicely done. The rooms are fully sized by NYC standards, and are immaculate and very attractive. I would return here in a heartbeat. The location is excellent. Umbrellas are provided in guest rooms as are IPod docks. Our room had a sucky view, but, for the rate we got, I'm not complaining. Anyone who gives the negative reviews this hotel received any serious thought can easily dispel any concerns by personally touring this property.",1
 Rooms much to small The toilet is in a pod in the room which was really not private also the shower is in a pod It reminded me of a hostel for adults the room price is too high for what is offered  Location and access to public transport was great ,0
 I would recommend more variety at breakfast The choise was pretty poor Either the coffee machine or the coffe bun was not good because the cappuccino I tried was the worst Considering that it is Italy and you can taste the best coffee ever One of the staff a guy members at reception was quite rude We were waiting for quite a time looking for some1 to help us with our bags and he made a look he didn t notice us The hotel is situated quite far away from the city center though close to a metro stop  The room was a good size pretty clean with a big size bathroom ,0

 Hotel feels worn out like it really could use a major overhaul The receptionist told me that they would charge me 10 GBP extra if I wanted internet access I feel this is unacceptable in our times This is very bad style to say the least  Pretty good location and nice classy lobby only the rooms don t keep what the lobby promises ,0
 Very noisy house cleaning staff meant we had early starts on each morning of our four day stay Not relaxing  Convenient location for the centre of the city and the museum quarter ,0
 None  We have stayed 5 nights in this hotel Really good location good price the service is very good people are helpful and willing to give us advice The room is modern and space is big enough comparing to other European hotels We had welcome drinks for free on the beautiful terrace where has a swimming pool It is a place which is quiet in a noisy neighborhood the Rambla is crowed and full of people highly recommend the hotel ,1
 Room was super small Very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside Very uncomfortable bed  Decent location but not for us as we thought we would be closer to winter wonderland ,0
"We loved this hotel; I have - boys ages ---- the suites were roomy and spacious to afford all five of us our comfort. The staff was pleasant and very accommodating. We stayed two nights and three days.

 Room very disappointing nothing like picture or description Central area convenient for travel,0
 We arrived to be asked for 100 deposit to be taken at the point of checking in I have never had this asked beforehand by other 5 hotels I have stayed in London I understand there is a need to register a card should you make purchases However unacceptable to charge a customer before even spending anything Also there was no do not disturb signs to put out for the cleaner and consequently we were woken up Despite having booked a luxury room we didn t see any signs of real luxury I felt like we could of stayed in A premier inn which would have been cheaper and had the same facilities The only thing that looked luxurious was the outside of the hotel as you walk towards it Definitely not worth the money I wouldn t stay here again  The beds were really comfortable ,0

No Negative Location and helpfulness friendliness of staff,1
 We found no slippers in the room but later we asked them from the housekeeper The bathroom area is a bit weird Some couples would not feel comfortable in it I would prefer to be isolated in bathroom Not close to the city center if you prefer walking  Best part of the hotel is the breakfast There s a plenty of choices It s located on a busy avenue Lots of shops and restaurants around Decent sized clean rooms ,1

 If i had to be picky one barman left us standing at the bar whilst he was making drinks only to eventually ask us to take a seat and wait for table service we didn t mind but we wish that he had told us straight away so then we weren t stood there waiting  The staff were lovely and friendly and the rooms were beautifuly clean and the food was delicious,1
 The fridge was quite small and the Volume on the TV was quite low but suppose that was considerate of the neighbours Even though it is not in the centre of Amsterdam it is very easy to get anywhere you wat to go  We liked everything Like most other reviewers we found the staff exceptional The room itself was very well appointed and exceptionally well kept Would definitely stay again It is in a very nice suburb and close to restaurants some shops and a nice little market Since it was in the burbs it was very quiet ,1
 Typical London basic hotel without warmth and small rooms Nothing to complain about as such but as its London it s seems an excuse to be unfriendly and perfunctory It was clean,0
 Wi Fi was rubbish 1 night did not work at all next weak staff very helpful location also roof top bar a great place to unwind,1
 The streets below are filled with party ers on the weekends  It was a clean a very well decorated hotel Very comfortable The only room in our whole trip with a bath tub ,1

 A small room Little space in the bathroom to put wash bags or hang wet towels Only one comfortable chair to sit on Very dirty windows which needed to be open for air circulation Unappetising breakfast mushrooms and eggs swimming in grease On the second day one female member of staff at breakfast chewing gum  The bed was comfortable The hotel was in a very good location close to Greenwich Park the Cutty Sark and the Maritime museum and River Thames ,0

 Our room was dark and dingey It was stiflingly hot with no a c The room was old with an ancient dark wood bed frame with chips and scuffs in the woodwork The hotel itself was ratty with torn paintings and paint falling off the woodwork Getting a snack after 11 pm was greeted with hostility in spite of their boasting 24 hour service We paid over 350 a night for substandard service and accommodation I recommend the Milestone  The concierge Richie and the breakfast Manger were delightful and welcoming The location was perfect ,0

 One request we made The only request was a thin soft pillow A hotel that claims to be rated 8 5 10 that can not facilitate this request indeed not even warn us in advance that you stock just one deep pillow will not score highly Our comfort was taken away by Golden Tulip not facilitating this specific request It was disappointing not to receive a response before our arrival  Staff location and general cleanliness ,0
 Cleaning Staff Security Quality Photo Position,0

 Only one small lift and used by house keeping so had to wait for a time to travel to the 5th floor Nespresso coffee machine in the room but no coffee pods offered Deluxe room but was very small ants in the bathroom in our last day I would not rate this hotel a 4 star and based on paying 200 per night exc breakfast I feel the bubbles hotel is over rated Far more other hotels in the Saint Germaine area to capture the same rate No parking which we knew at time of booking and 10 15 min walk to nearest car park  Friendly reception staff who gave us a complimentary bottle of their house champagne for my partner s birthday celebration ,0

"Seriously? No WiFi? It's ----.
And it's in the flight path. 
And hallway noise is incredibly loud -- you can hear doors slamming and people talking on phones or in person
And if you're on the pool side of the hotel...last night there were people partying outside at -am and I could hear every word with my balcony door closed 
...if you're a light sleeper, don't stay here. 
Also the ice machine on my floor is broken.
Overall...lame.",0
 Waiting for friends in the lobby was very difficult nowhere to sit The bar especially from early evening onwards was always full The croissants were excellent The staff very helpful and friendly,1
The rooms are pretty good and the service is above mediocore. As I've stayed in so many sub-standard hotels lately this one is certainly one that can be described as at least the minimum a hotel should be. The fitness center is nice but the pool is almost non-existent.,0
 Poor welcome at the reception Delayed check in due to room unavailability Room settled for one person while booking was for two  Location well connected to the main attractions ,0
No Negative Close proximity to Wembley,1
 Ridiculously small single bedroom in a cellar not even in the main hotel with no windows I was unable to stand up in the bathroom to shower or use the toilet I had to wait 15 minutes for a table to come free for breakfast mid week stay due to particularly small restaurant area I had to wait an exorbitantly long time to be attended to by the hotel receptionist who was more interested in giving some new foreign visitors to London a full run down on attractions worth visiting and made no apology for keeping me waiting  Convenient location for the Earls Court area,0
 Access to the pool should be free for guests The design of the building and the really amazing food,1

 The rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings  Great central location and a monument to Victorian grandeur on the architecture of the hotel ,0
 Very small room difficult to move around hotel not very meticulously cleaned there were stains on the bathroom floor from the previous guests spider web on the ceiling corner Very expensive for what it offers  Location not bad abt 15 minute relaxed walk to Marble arch Queensway tube station just around the corner lots of buses to all directions 1 minute away Personell polite and professional ,0

 No free TV in room futon bed too low for mobility Nice and modern neat comfy,0
 The terrace on the top floor was chaos Access was only possible if you queued and as a hotel guest you were not giving any priority but stood behind people who were not even staying in the hotel The car took 30 minutes to get delivered back to me even though I requested it 10 minutes before coming down to check out The spa on the top floor has to be reserved and once again in a hotel so large it is not easy to find the time you want In general this is a 4 star hotel there are far better choices for real 5 star luxury in Barcelona at the same price  Location and nothing more,0
 Traffic noise and air con heating unit noisy  Location Close to railway station ,0
 The room wasnt ready till exactly 2 30 and was promised 2 00No Positive,0
 Check in was very slow Room facilities in our superior room were not particularly impressive The heating air conditioning system blew extremely hot air and could not be adjusted On complaining we were told this was how it worked at this time of year so why bother having in room controls The side of the bath was hanging off One thin pillow was provided per person We had a view of a large and indeed noisy air conditioning unit paintbrushes ladders and other equipment left out immediately outside our window  Good location for the areas we were planning to visit ,0
 Check in was from 3pm but the room wasn t ready until 5pm No Positive,1
 Disappointing for a 4 star hotel The bathrooms are badly set up the shower is wheelchair accessible but has no door so it is impossible to prevent water from going all over the floor The beds are a bit firm and the blankets provided not that warm Power outlet in the bathroom had a short which caused the room to black out Dinner was OK but staff seemed very under pressure even though there were not that many diners and many tables got the wrong orders ours was OK but took a long time and the waitress forgot our wine Breakfast was average  Very powerful air conditioning Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful Underground parking with a lift directly to the room floors ,0

 Nothing The location was perfect the staff the room the atmosphere We loved The Hoxton,1
 we had a bad view and the room was next to the fire exit housekeepers storage so it was very noisy early in the morning we asked for an iron and it took them 30 mins to bring it up they also had a technical problem so we didn t have hot water for the whole day location was ok just 5 mins walk from port olimpic,0
 Room was small but we knew that and it was ok for us But if you have bigger luggage international travellers it could be a problem  Room was very clean smelled nice amazing location between two metro stations Front desk was nice we were a few minutes late for the checkout but they were nice about it ,1

Pros: Great location and very friendly staff.
Cons: The hotel room was old and very dusty. The bathroom was not well ventilated.
Be careful of breakfast and parking fees. We received --USD breakfast coupons but a coffee alone was already -USD. We were told that parking was -- USD per day with in and out rights. What they failed to tell us was that every time we left, we had to sign-out. So we ended up with a ---+USD parking bill.",0

"I have stayed at several Thompson's in New York and have never been disappointed. While the Gild does not have the Soho-LES-Tribeca address, the quiet neighborhood can be welcoming during the weekends. More importantly, the staff remains on its toes. During our stay, the service was nothing short of excellent. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay in NYC.",1
 You have to request ice through room service Called down for a bucket around 7pm Called again with a gentle reminder at 7 30 He s on his way up Called again 15 minutes later and was told they would contact room service again we had dialled room service but whatever After a further ten minutes my husband went down to the bar himself No one brought us ice  Great brekfast buffet Free wine beer and appies from 6 30 8 00 pm Server was certainly not stingy with topping off your glass You simply MUST eat at the Bugis Street Brasserie ,1
 First floor room on road side suffers from bad traffic noise in the morning Had to sleep with ear plugs They offered to change it but to a lower standard of room or to a better one but with extra charge Not all but some of the staff are quite indefferent and even clueless in giving directions even to the central station  Very good breakfast Spacious room they are not all the same though ,0

 The cost of breakfast 25pp so I enjoyed a full english at the local wetherspoons Everything about the place was fantastic,1
 Maybe mats for the bedside tables to stand a hot cup on it feels wrong to put hot crockery on a polished surface though some previous tenant hadn t felt so It would be SO nice if hotels would offer the package as Bed and Breakfast rather than tacking that on as an extra who doesn t want breakfast  Just a very nice hotel nicely different because it s independent and not the usual chain everything the same look Musical themed room was nice Staff pleasant and attentive ,1

Extremly good vbalue for money...good breakfast and very courteous staff,1
 the reception staff seemed rather inexperienced clueless and cold the rooms offer only minimal storage and definitely not enough for a weekend stay for two people the rooms are small and the decor although quirky is not functional the doors bang loudly and you can hear everything we were expecting a fridge and a coffee maker in a 4 star hotel but the amenities were basic the location is great very central and in a quiet street off a lovely residential area communal areas are very nice and welcoming and it s very clean,0

"The Good:
Was able to check-in early. Did not have much staff contact.
The room was nice, clean, and quite. Sized nicely. The internet worked great. (Wasn't slow) The location is close to the interstate-main road.
The Bad:
The TV did not have LOCAL channels on it. (ABC,CBS,NBC NOT even PBS!). Only national channels. No pool or free breakfast. No Daily housekeeping.
A LOT of internal room noise at night (Refrigerator running, Air Conditioner on)
A lot of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""little"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" nightlights at night, from all the light displays in the room. (Microwave,DVD Display, Alarm Clock) The room was not completely dark. Made it difficult to sleep. The location was not close to any shopping or restaurants.",1

 The reception is a bit of a free for all more look over function Location was ideal for the purpose of our visit,1
"The Lenox Hotel is well-situated for shops, ideal when it rains, public transport and not too far to walk to the Freedom Trail.
The reception was extremely friendly and helpful as were all staff throughout our three-night stay.
The rooms were decorated in a traditional style, well-maintained and very comfortable. 
We used the hotel for one evening meal and were impressed by the sensible menu and good food. We also had breakfast each day, and once we had modified our orders to reflect the generous portion sizes, thoroughly enjoyed the meals and had no need of lunch! 
As a hotel for tourists looking for comfort, individuality , friendliness and an efficient yet relaxed ambience, it is ideal.",1

 When we arrived they only had on record a small double reserved when we had booked a superior double Even when we produced the Booking com confirmation they still tried to palm us off with a standard double In the end they checked us into a superior double What was annoying was that the check in process took 25mins and made us late for dinner No Positive,0
"We really enjoyed the location being close to the harbor & North End. Subway entrance right across the circle entrance made it very easy to travel around the city. Unfortunately we were not able to get much sleep due to the noise from the bars located around the hotel. A previous post had warned of the problem, and they were right. It affected us even on the -th floor. I really liked the area, but might look at the other Marriott property next time. The internet also did not work in our room & we wasted a morning while the engineer worked on the problem. You use your room key for elevator access & our last morning my son & I were locked out of the elevator & our room twice. Front desk was helpful.",0

 Rooms were very small nothing like the photos Bar staff were lovely,0
"The Westin is fine, don't get me wrong. The rooms are spacious, there is a mini bar, lcd tv and great work desk. The bathrooms are modern enough and contain amenities and a bathtub. The lobby gorgeous, staff attentive enough. 
It's just bland. The furnishings in the rooms are not of the high quality that Westin ones usually are. The fixtures a little off. It looks like a hotel that has been renovated surely, but not by the Westin group (their 'feel' is very distinctive). 
I called once for towels and the request wasn't returned, otherwise the service was fine. Would I stay again? Yes, but money better spent elsewhere really.",0
 Hotel is small and pokey and the street is not very nice place to walk at night The walls of rooms were very thin and could hear everything from the bathroom next door Wifi signal very poor too  Comfy bed and clean room Staff helpful and friendly Very close to gare du nord and sacre cour ,0

 This is not the first time when I was there But this time it was so different starting with receving the keys from one old appartment on the 5th floor changing the key for another appartment where I ve found a very dirty chair with food for young babies inside the breakfast poor this time My opinion is that they have to improve a little bit the cleaning services to renovate the rooms from all the floors and the breakfast should have more than 3 sausages or 4 croissants  The staff was kind and ready to help ,0
No Negative Everything was fantastic especially hotel Berna team nice people who work at this hotel Grazie mille ,1
 Room sizes are pretty cramping minimalistic in everything they offer I did not even have space to take a picture of the room as I could not get all of it in a frame No replacement milk satchets for us for the coffee Breakfast is very good wifi is good too For those coming by train to Gare D est nothing could be closer Also Metro access at the doorstep ,0

 Slow check in and charge for wifi Convenient location,0
 Staff are not friendly we had to stand in long que and found that they gave us the wrong room when we came back they changed it but with rude behavior room was totally uncomfortable mattress was hard AC is not working with the excuse that it is still winter eventhough it was hot not good isolated room from noise we hear the other rooms and the housekeeping when they push a noisy trolly and speaking near room with children run in corridors all time Sunday there are workers in the garden with loud machines No near restaurants and hard to reach the hotel with car  Clean room and wide good wifi connection Breakfast buffet with good varieties Location near a train station and free parking Nice decorations ,0
"The customer service upon check-in was terrible. The staff was not friendly and the wait was very long. The room service was mediocre at best. I noticed trash around the pool but when I informed the staff, they failed to take care of it. The bathroom wasn't quite clean and there were stains on the carpet in our suite. It was an all around unpleasant experience and I do not recommend this hotel.",0
 The staff were very rude Threatening me with a 200 bill for smoking when I don t even smoke Then taking 100 out of my bank as soon as I got there as I was unaware of this I was then 100 down for my trip They then didn t give my girlfriend 50 off happy hour drinks saying they don t do happy hour anymore when it clearly states on your website happy hour is between 6 8 And now I still haven t received my 100 back yet Never again would I stayin this hotel You don t get your value for money No Positive,0
 Staff behavior very unpleasant it was my first time facing this attitude in amsterdam Always they were friendly Furnitures and high tech support,0
Needed a pet friendly place and spouse wanted to stay in Charlotte as he has never been. Guess traveling with a pet and having to be placed in a pet friendly room is exactly that the smell of previous pets who have stayed in the same room. My allergies were bothering me the whole time. We decided to venture out on foot only to have to turn around and get the car as we didnt realize we were as far away from downtown as we were. Enjoyed drinks and food in the bar area and food wasn't bad. Biggest turnoff was having to pay for wifi. Parking fees could have been a little more reasonable.,0
 Too expensive for what you get Room was very old fashioned Pool and gym area were dirty looking and a bit disgusting Very strange route through public gym to get to swimming pool which was not as nice as the photos Gym and pool area smelled like sweat and pool was over chlorinated  Fantastic location but ridiculously expensive for what you get Standard enough 4 star hotel for the price of a top 5 star hotel ,0
 I was allocated a room next to the lift which was very noisy Would request a quiet room in future  Beautiful modern hotel in a superb location ,1
 Room space is narrow good treatment,0
 Nothing  Very clean excellent breakfast plenty of choice very helpful staff The situation was ideal Easy walking distance to the centre of Vienna public transport airport shuttle and a wide selection of bars and restaurants just around the corner,1

 Small restaurant and bar area but in a location like this why would you be eating and drinking at the hotel  Main requirement of hotel was the location close to a music venue I was attending However the hotel is very close to some great small restaurants and shops especially on Camden Passage ,1
 Every Thing The Hotel Was Doing The Renewed When We Been There From 10am They Were Started Working And Lots Of Voices,0

 Didn t like that we couldn t open our window so our room was very stuffy even with air conditioning unit on Breakfast was lovely Had something for everyone Staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome,1
 Cooked breakfast could have been better for the price To accommodate the loss of the hour we could have breakfast in bed with no additional charges,1
 Long trek to eat in town  Close proximity to ExCel and the Dive Show ,0
 I paid for everything using the spa pool or steam room breakfast etc The location is good I was able to walk to the city centre though it takes about 45 mintyes I don t mind I love walking It s about 10 to 15 minutes if you drive The rooftop pool was good you get to see a lovely view of the city ,0

Stayed in a King Suite which was quite large. Clean and the bed was comfortable. Didn't use the TV or amenities. Parking was $-- and I could walk to the conference I was attending.,0
No Negative Perfect,1
Got this property on hotwire. It was a decent place for the price paid. That said...I would never pay their full price for this property. You can tell that they have updated it but there was mold growing in my tile and to me I thought if you had so much invested in the furnishings...it may be a good idea to spray a little tilex. They advertise that their airport shuttle runs every half hour and this is false. I got to the front desk a quater till and then waited a half hour for the shuttle driver who was rather unfreindly to come out of the hotel. I would reccomend if you get a cheap deal on hotwire but thats the only way. Their service was lacking as well as the cleanliness. I WOULD stay here again if I got the same deal on hotwire (which was $--.--).,0
 Rude management who had absolutely no sense of sympathy in a unique circumstance extremely bad PR and over all no loyalty to paying costumes I have very little positive comments to make about this hotel I tried to cancel my stay here due to family emergency and the management were appalling to deal with ,0

"We stayed at the Radisson Fishermans Wharf for - nights and adored our time in this beautiful city. The hotel is in a great location wereby it is peaceful and great for exploring but also has easy access to the city. The hotel is basic and not like a Standard Radisson in the UK. Rooms are clean, small and basic. There are not many facilities at the hotel- the pool is small and there is no restaurant only a food cart for breakfast. 
The hotel is great for a short stay if you just want to get out and explore. Ensure you get good value for money with this hotel as it is very similar to a travel lodge.",0

"I recently tried to surprise my hubby with a romantic weekend . I wanted to try somewhere new. We usually atay at the Mark Hopkins or the Fairmont sometimes Marriot. The pictures looked like a cute boutique hotel. It is not cute ! The place is at best an old motel with a paint job and garage grade carpet. The beds are hard the furniture is cheap. I feel sorry for the employees who are actually so nice and helpful. They weren't surprised when we came right back down to check out. On Expedia it had a - rateing ,so I thought why not. The worst part was NO PARKING the guests are expected to go out into the nieghborhood and find thier own parking. They couldn't offer any tips for where to go. The sad part is the Mark Hopkins was only $--- more than this dump.",0

 My son and his partner were competing in the London Marathon and requested an early breakfast but the staff said they could not supply it before 7 30 We have stayed in hotels in London before and they have promoted an early Marathon breakfast This spoilt our whole stay as we had to dash out to local supermarket and buy yogurts serial etc for them to fuel up Perhaps you could think again before another year there are 40 000 people competing in this event  Good powerful shower nice to have a fridge in the room ,0

 This seems to be just a secure accommodation area with many appartments flats Got to say I am not mad keen on the area It is nice to look at with some reasonable if expensive restaurants but to me it is missing character Unless I missed something there is very little to do there although a walk along the river is enjoyable  The breakfast was lovely and just as I like a good choice of different styles The room was clean and large enough with the necessary facilities including free wifi It is close to the river and a short walk to the marina too ,1

When we went to pay he told us he could not give us the bill and we would have to wait -- minutes! He was not busy, just stood there and told other customers the same thing. We tried to complain at the front desk but the manager was not in.",0
 How can this establishment be a 4 hotel This was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at You can hear everything from outside from the neighbors and from the corridor The door to the staircase was right across my room The hotel should use some grease on the door as it creak like it has never seen any lubricant Dampening the noise of the door when it closes would be advisable too The bed was lumpy the bath tub dirty No Positive,0

"The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were all very professional and polite. The hotel is showing its age and is need of a major overhaul. The plumbing and fixtures (my room----) were horrible! Bathtub stopper was also missing. The HD flat screen was nice. 
The breakfast was good but costs $-- + tip. Seems to be a lot of noise and stuff going on in this hotel. Don't expect a quiet evening. 
This hotel does give the Government Rate, so that is why I ended up here on this trip. I have stayed at a dozen other hotels in El Paso that are much better for the same price with free breakfast. Unfortunately, this trip I made the wrong choice. I will NOT stay here again.",0

 Missing slippers and bathrobe in the room No drinking water in the room Dirty carpets Swimming pool is reserved for the pool parties not possible to get the place close to swimming pool people from outside are coming for these parties I was expecting to get the best service not to be send far away from the pool because hotel is having some extra parties not for hotel guestsNo Positive,0

"We checked in at the The Lowell after a dismal night at Le Parker Meridien. We were looking for a comfortable, elegant, up-scale hotel room in a small hotel and we found just that The Lowell. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and hospitable....far from snobby as another reviewer mentioned. This is a special place where one can escape the busy city outside its doors.",1
 The breakfast was too expensive 12 euros There was no cold milk The drawback of the location is that it is about 35 mins away from the city centre but the tram network closest stop Tesarekplatz is trust worthy frequency is 4 6 mins in the morning and afternoon  The room was really large and clean The staff was friendly and helpful The hotel is located on the SW corner of a wonderful large park Erholungsgebiet Wienerberg and many rooms have a view of the park The breakfast was rich and of high quality I loved the chocolate cake I would definetely choose it again ,1

"Great location. Nice Staff. Very small but clean rooms. However, the hotel should invest in more insolation between rooms and triple pane windows for noise reduction and also check that guests are quiet between midnight and - a.m.",0
 There was a cockroach in the room which I had to kill I didn t have enough time to inform the hotel I was surprised as this is a 4 star hotel The tea cups in the room were plastic which is a bit of a shame The shower bathroom was standard The TV remote was difficult to use you have to go out of your way to point and change the channels Most of the staff were friendly however some seemed not interested at all  The bed pillows sofa were really comfortable memory foam There was a good view from the room Room was quiet spacious ,0

"This is a Hampton Inn - no need for endless detail on the room.

Notable aspects: excellent coordination of shuttle service from front desk, good wi-fi, and decent quiet for an airport hotel.
I came in at -:-- pm for an early meeting at the airport, and the front desk staff were terrific about having me picked up promptly, and more importantly, getting me back in the morning without having to worry the timing, etc. It may have been due to my Hilton Hhonors status, but it was a level of service I don't usually see from mid-line properties.
Also really appreciated the rooms being quiet - no jet noise (maybe I was just tired) nor highway-sirens-traffic to impede badly needed sleep.
A solid option for business travelers.",1
 Not that we didn t like but we were hopping for one of your DJ s or bands to be on at the weekend  The layout of Aloft was great and different to anywhere we have stayed before We felt very welcome by helpful staff We were visiting London Boat Show and so good to find that Aloft is connected to Excel Would definitely recommend to friends and work colleagues We hope to return in the future ,1

 Nothing I did not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
 The wait at the spa was excessively long there weren t enough seats for everyone waiting Having to sit in a short dressing gown in a crowded room with several men is not my idea of a relaxing way to wait for a spa treatment The wet area was also crowded and was much smaller than it looked in the photos Apart from the wonderful massage the whole spa experience was very disappointing Toiletries in room not replaced until I asked Not enough breakfast tea bags supplied Bed too hard No slippers provided in room  Leo the masseur was magic one of the best massages I have ever had Reception staff were helpful ,0

 The bed was rock hard No mirror in room Room was dusty Staff wasn t that friendly Would not rate at a 4 star and do not feel the place is worth a 4 star I feel with it being a 4 star should not of had to pay more for a cooked breakfast The view,0
 Twin room in the basement felt closed in not enough drawers and plug sockets  Food in the Atlantic was exceptional,0
 We were originally sent to a room that already had people booked into that room There were personal belongings everywhere The lady at the front desk was quite abrasive with us when we went down to the front desk A lot of rules in the hotel that would put us off staying again such as having to pay per 15 minutes if you go over your allocated time in the restaurant or having to leave a deposit for bedside lamps  Close to Tram line,0
 The cost was much more that other hotels of similar standard in the area I was charged more than was quoted by Booking com and a prepayment was taken from my bank account a month before our arrival The first two nights we spent there were in a very small basement room where we could not even open the frig or wardrobe as the bed was wedged against them The staff originally refused to move us to a room that was pictured on your website and our booking sheet I would not have booked the tiny room we were given and only after explaining the misrepresentation were we changed for the last 3 nights of the stay  The bedding was fresh and clean Good location ,0

 We stayed in an executive room but sadly no complimentary bottle of wine or fruit which is the norm with other hotels with executive rooms But I would still most definitely stay here again Fantastic hotel to stay in close to Covent Garden Theatres etc Staff were very friendly and made us feel most welcome ,1
 The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details I like the location and probably the staff was trying to assist to accommodate mi in the hotel when three floor was out of order,0
 Rooms are not much different to a travelodge except they are smaller They took the payment out of the wrong account I rang up 3 times and was told that they would contact me back they didn t so i was then told to send an email I did and no reply So disappointed with the customer service after leaving A member of staff walked into my room whilst i was changing At the time i didnt mind but this along with the poor customer service has made me not want to stay again  Lovely breakfast helpful concierge,0
 Location is middle of no where Booking com said it was 0 5mi from the shard which is why I booked Turned out to be an hour and half walk or an hour car journey due to traffic The local tube was enough to make anyone not want to travel by tube again Hotel prices are ridiculously expensive for the facilities and location If this was more centre London then fair enough but it isn t and made the whole weekend trip more expensive than it needed to be I can t see why there would be any other reason to stay at this hotel  Clean hotel nothing else ,0
 In terms of value for money this is one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in No Positive,0

"The place was great - clean rooms and excellent location. I am a light sleeper, though, and we had two major problems. Large garbage cans were dragged down the alley on both Monday and Friday morning at -.--am that were VERY loud and the people dragging them were equally loud. In addition, there was a loud clicking noise in the alley facing south that did not allow us to sleep very well. it went on and off all night. If you are a light sleeper, don't stay here.",0
 The rooms are very very smallNo Positive,0
 We booked a room with 2 single beds but upon arrival received 1 double bed When we asked for another room they said that nothing else is available Then a house keeper moved beds apart from each other There was a lot of dust on the carpet between beds House keeper was changing linens and cleaning the carpet while we were staying in the door Service is poor Everything looks better on photos than it is in reality  Location and breakfast,0
No Negative The hotel is fantastic everything you would expect from a decent hotel but unique enough to make it an enjoyable experience And not just a random name the Mona Lisa was stolen and hidden here for a while Location was perfect within walking distance to everywhere that we wanted with plenty of great cafes and restaurants close by Above all the welcome and customer service was exceptional which can t help but make you happy thank you ,1
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights and overall it was an ok experience. The positives: great location (you can walk to the Smithsonian and the National Mall), awesome roof top pool (only a few hotels in the city have this), large rooms, and nice bar-lounges. The negatives: older, bathrooms (our floor tile looked dirty, slightly peeling wallpaper), construction noise in the afternoon for hours! , very expensive individual breakfasts ($----- a plate), or you could wait in a very long line for coffee and a muffin in the foyer cafe. Overall, I would stay again IF I got another good rate for a - day weekend.",0

 The location of my room was under where breakfast was served so I was woken up every day at 7am and kept awake I did not enjoy this at all The hotel also charged me 4 times for my authorisation and I am currently waiting to get that reimbursed When I called the hotel one of the girls laughed at me and said I wouldn t understand I was trying to explain what had happened and she said she would send me an email instead That was 4 days ago Still no email Still waiting for a final reimbursement  The bed was amazing it really was ,0
 Staff was rude unfriendly and insulting They would not speak English in front of guests and would talk about them I understood what they were saying and it wasn t nice The carpet was old and filthy The dining room was disgustingly dirty I was afraid to sit on the chairs they were so soiled I also found something weird in the milk and gave it to one of the waitresses and was never apologized to nor was the problem corrected No Positive,0
No Negative I had a great time here Adella and Charlie and everyone else were so friendly They helped me out setting up tours and places to go Even made reservations for me Adella gave me an extraordinary welcoming gift I felt so special And their breakfast is to die for It s a feast ,1
 We didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website Which we hadn t used to book They also said work was happening 9 5 but on the second day we were woken before 8 30am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook On the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery It was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round  The shower was nice,0
 the breakfast was not good and the egg was not properly boiled I asked for a double bed and got twin beds the locatiom is not good either and for a 4 star hotel it looked like a 3 star and the view was not good  I liked the bath tub and the staff was very friendly ,0

"Perfect location...within walking distance to almost anything you desire. Rooms were adequate. Staff there to please. However, I believe it was over-priced. Except for lemonade in the lobby...and coffee pot in room...there was nothing else complimentery.
I have stayed in many hotels...with less rates..and at least received a complimentery breakfast.",0
 Would have liked a few english channels on the tv Staff very friendly and helpful excellent location clean and comfortable room,1
 The evening night staff was rude when I asked about the the double booking fee  Confusion on arrival as it wasn t clear that I had to bring the same credit card as when I booked the hotel Your staff made it difficult to understand what the problem was The system could be more flexible ,0
 The bedroom was absolutely dreadful The noise from the air conditioning units for the whole of the hotel were just beneath our window making it impossible to sleep We rang the night manager at 3 o clock in the morning to Change rooms eventually getting to bed about 3 30 am We reported it to the day manager the following morning who said he would take the complaint up with his department and booking com to resolve the complaint He said we would receive a email within the next two days to resolve our complaint we are still waiting  The public rooms were very pleasant and comfortable ,0
 Room needs complete renovation No bars airconditioning is hopeless  The location is great,0
 We had booked a superior room but in this hotel the term superior room actually means standard room Secondly you must phone the hotel beforehand and insist you have a room at the rear as the front rooms suffer dreadfully from noise from the trams This hotel is wonderfully situated within easy reach of main attractions,0

 Very tiny room for single small bathroom with a window which opens in shower A single bad closed to the wall On the window can see next buildings wall very close That amplified the claustrophobic sensation I believe the plase was originally designed to be a storing room beeing on staircase just two steps from the elevator A year before I have been pleased to stay in the same hotel but in a proper room Now I felt not confortable at a charge of 107 euro per night Not fair Care for customers,0

Our room at the rear was plain, small and shabby. By all accounts the rooms at the front are the most desirable and difficult to get. There are many long term residents and there appeared to be a small religious cult in residence on our floor. The corridors are wide, gloomy and mysterious and reception is full of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""art"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" contributed by residents.

In some rooms the door frames-modling was hanging off, the rooms felt dirty. The desk in more than one of our rooms were wobbley and dangerous.

The business that invited me to lecture in New York City booked the hotel for me as usual, but this time I was pleasantly surprised with a new and unique hotel, the Blue Moon Hotel in Manhattan, New York. I was there for one night only, but they were very kind to letting me check in early since the room was ready. It had an atmosphere of artistic elegance but not pretentious and very comfortable. There was clear attention to detail, which I did not find in other NY hotels. The owners and staff were extremely kind, welcoming and helpful. I am looking forward to staying there again.",1

The location is a very quick drive to Sea World, though a pretty far drive to the River Walk. The check-in was uneventful. We needed extra towels and pillows and were able to pick them up at the desk quickly. It was quieter than we expected given that we were very close to the office.
The biggest problem was the free breakfast. Get there very early. We waited -- minutes in a massive mob for the waffles. There is no where near enough seating, so plan to take your food back to your room. It was a zoo with almost everyone on the hotel on the same schedule due to Sea World.",0

 the hotel was under renovation upon arrival it was like a construction site serious difficulties by the front office agents to understand corporate billing requirements guest elevator from reception level to ground floor when not off then very slow Poor very poor breakfast maids constantly ignored the do not disturb sign coffee machine in the room mini bar without extra charge,0
 Price was much higher than better hotels around there Very old looking in need of serious refurbishment Cancellation policy said one day where in fact you need to cancel 36 hours before checkin had to cancel my last night and it took me 2 calls to booking com and going back twice to the hotel to do this No Positive,0

 Fitness room not great Perfect location and very comfortable and large room Staff are excellent and friendly Breakfast is delicious and a real treat Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel ,1
 the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still  the staff was very nice and hotel looks great from outside but not so much inside rooms ,0
 I suppose like everywhere drinks were a bit expensive and i thought 23 each for breakfast was too much especially when there are plenty of places to eat 2 minutes walk away around St Paul s Cathedral The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful The room was excellent with a very comfortable bed and large shower We ate in Benihana restaurant Japanese and the food was very very good Overall an excellent time at a great hotel will definitely recommend to family friends and work colleagues,1
 Courtyard was a mess Clean room,0

 We asked for double bed but we got a twin room instead without any explanation or excuse The elevator is slow the parking is 19 eur per day and the garage is very complicated to use The room is not very clean for example there was mold on a shower holder and stains on the bathroom door I had some problems with internet in the room as well even though you mostly pay extra for it  The location is good for Vienna near Schoenbrunn and near metro station 6 stops to the city centre The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious ,0
This is our favorite hotel in Philadelphia. It has the charm of a bed and breakfast with tea and cookies served in the afternoon and wine and cheese on Wednesdays. The buffet breakfast that is included with the cost of the room is more than ample. The hotel has convenient public parking nearby and is in the most charming section of the city. We have been coming here for more than eight years and we highly recommend it to others. There is a lovely gift store next door that completes your visit as well as many restaurants and movie houses that are within walking distance.,1
 Nothing could have been better Extremely courteous service and very clean Felt very wellcomed,1
No Negative Everything is fantastic location just across the road from the Centrale station helpful staff excellent breakfasts fruits vegetables cold dishes hot dishes cakes even fresh orange juice very quiet and clean rooms personal WiFi hotspot in every room The restaurant provides fantastic meals order the Cotoletta there for your lunch you ll never regret ,1
 Decor could do with freshening up Staff very welcoming very pleasant,0
 Scandalous situation standard room 2 5 x 2 5 m was without normal window overlooking the well only gap between the walls Standard room too small for two people No information regarding no window during registration The hotel is suitable for those who like to live in the closet or in the basement This hotel effectively discouraged me for my next visit to Paris Superior room was very good Staying at the hotel spoiled the trip to Paris Avoid registration of standard room Horrible  Very clean Very good and very polite staff Fantastic localization ,0
 At check out I had the worest expreince everNo Positive,0
 The service wasn t very good Some of the front desk staff was helpful some of them weren t The room service was awful I sent two different orders back on two different occasions Way too expensive for the quality and quantity of food However the breakfast was nice  Good location shopping Imax theater restaurants and train station within a 5 minute walk ,0
 No where near the city centre Spa isn t include Rooms aren t insulated adequately Rubbish check in had to pay 3euros for tax not on the website per night Noisy rooms Room service called at 9 to clean room Kettle didn t work in Room and when I asked for a new one they didn t bring it The biggest con is the spa which isn t part of the deal you have to pay extra for it and then you have to rent there towels for 2 euros A massively overrated hotel don t stay here,0
 Our room was underground in a basement with no natual light and a concrete wall for a view The reception bar area turns into a hispter disco at night so don t think you ll get a quiet drink Reception check in was slow and understaffed Long queue We were double charged for breakfast While sorting it out we found out the breakfast is 17 via booking com and 10 at the hotel avoid Price paid 199 for room and expensive breakfast No Positive,0
 Service at the bar  Amazing bed ,1
 The room assigned was over the entrance which was brightly lit we were unable to completely block out the outside lightNo Positive,0
 the Air Con is not working well and they gave me a fan as an alternative No Positive,0
 The free wifi is only in the public spaces not the rooms which in this day and age feels a little ridiculous especially when many people will be visitors to the UK or on business so it s even more important The rooms and the whole hotel in general could do with a refurb and some investment into new wall paper lights new bathroom fixtures that have broken I wed surprised for a Britannia hotel they would let a room out that clearly needed some love There was also no warning on the amount of noise that would affect guests from the nearby developments as more luxury apartment blocks spring up It s the perfect location for me but not sure I could go back  The hotel has a great location and helpful staff ,0
 very rude staff not helpful little knowledge and billing was bad taken a deposit not a pre auth on card took 2 weeks to get money back very modern and clean,0
 Not quite as lavish as I was expecting but still great nonetheless Great location next to Anne Frank House,1
No Negative outstanding great staff great upgrade outstanding room wowwwww,1
 We would have prefered a larger room next time we will but the rooms were kept very well Would suggest a shelf over the basin  Helpful staff specially Camilia on the front desk Great location for shopping transport restaurants walking cycling Would stay again Our first visit to the Hotel ,1
No Negative Everything is perfect I feel at home,1
 Nothing It was marvelous  Selection and Variety,1
 Would ve been nice if minibar was free or included in price of room  Chose this place for the rooftop terrace breakfast and it was amazing Rooms are admittedly small but modern and well designed Hotel restaurant Goulasch and Champagne perfect for a late night snack Hotel is a brisk 7 10 min walk from Stadtpark station and also an easy walk from the Opera area ,1
 It was a little bit cold in the room  I was asking them to check in earlier and my room was ready before the fixed time The room was very nice and for a 4star hotel this price was really ok Was really good smell on the corridor ,1
 Swimming pool was not available one of the reasons we booked the hotel was for this facility as we had a small child and hoped to take him swimming  Good facilities,1
 N A We found the staff welcoming very helpful for information on travel places to see arrangements for extra Birthday treat and upgrading Special thanks to the staff in restaurant and bar very polite and helpful ,1
 The staff was very rude not welcoming and not helpful at all The restaurant was constantly closed for guests without any notice due to events Whenever we asked the staff something we got a rude answer not looking for solutions The hotel itself is nice just very far away from the city and absolutely nothing around there However the staff ruined the stay No Positive,0
 located in very ethnic Middle Eastern neighborhood will not stay there again bell staff very accomodating,0
 Two small beds pushed together instead of a double queen bed Location was very central,1
 The room was right by the lift and there was no carpet outside the lift so you could hear footsteps people outside the door at night and early in the morning  King size bed large fluffy towels subtle modern decor tea and coffee facilities not a bad size room for London Location was perfect for many of the sites we wanted to visit Also great local cafes for breakfast ,1
 Breakfast We had continental No decent fresh uncut bread or rolls available to go with the cheese and meats Only very ordinary sliced bread was offered good only for toasting No bagels or cream cheese for the smoked salmon The croissants seemed stale and bland cheap No plain ordinary water to be had unless I bought a bottle Note most diabetics can t drink fruit juice The area around the cereals was so messy All together breakfast was a thoroughly unpleasant experience Oh and PLEASE change your bar price list you sell water from Harrogate Note the spelling It is NOT spelt Harrowgate You should change that  Very comfy bed and pillows Great shower ,1
 When we arrived in the room there was a puddle of water near the toilet and the toilet paper on the wall was wet We called the desk and they sent someone up to fix the problem The door to the adjoining room was unlocked an apparent oversight and security risk  The room was larger than most rooms we ve experienced in Europe The resturant next door was excellent ,0
No Negative H tel et staff tr s corrects ,1
 The lift was quite slow  very good value for money considering the location Nice building friendly helpful staff ,1

 For a 4 star hotel you could have provided toothbrush paste Location,1
 Wasn t sure if drinks etc left in the room were complimentary which was a same if it was as we did not use these A sign explaining this would have been helpful Need to change the curtains as well these did not meet in the middle or cover the sides so there was a lot of sunlight first thing  lovely staff and rooms We had a room by the lift but this was not a problem and didn t effect us noise wise Air con was great and location fab Get the tube to Queensway as it much easier Lovely restaurants etc around the corner and a quiet area off the main street ,1
No Negative Staff simply cannot do enough for you in this bijoux home away from home ,1
 Despite one comment in my booking despite having double checked with the reception on my arrival they invoiced me the two rooms and paid them directly on my credit card whereas I asked 2 times that they had to be paid separately The people at the desk did no effort to correct the situation and did not excuse In addition the location is ugly around and I paid around 200 for a room that should not exceed 100  No real good location ,0
 Sofa bed was uncomfortable and when pulled out it took up most of the living room  Bed was extremely comfy,1
 Staff rude poor attitude no customer service skills Floor very dusty Shower Toilet is a wetroom Room very small  Location really good near Whitechapel subway easy to access Gatwick Airport and St Pancreas Station Comfy bed Air conditioning Generally quiet location Costa coffee across from hotel ,0
 Attitude of the staff was very horrible Not friendly very discriminating No Positive,0
 I picked the hotel specifically because it had parking When we arrived we were told it was full and to park in the multi storey close by This was ok but when we collected our car having already checked out we were charged 98 for two days parking There was no offer from the hotel to even contribute to this This did spoil what was otherwise a great stay  The location is brilliant at the top of the ramblas The pool is not huge but perfect for cooling off after sight seeing and our kids loved it There is a nice pool bar where we all enjoyed lunch The staff were helpful and welcoming ,1
 The staff was arrogant the shower was broken i had a child of 2 years there the breakfast not so good This was my 4 time there and it is my last time,0
 A few issues with the room but the staff whilst miserable duly sorted straight away Charging for parking at 25 per day when it used to be secure but now offered to anyone from the street is very unfair Noise from families with kids playing football is an issue as it would seem they get preference as never any rooms available to over look the park but the families with kids always have these rooms  Location was perfect for me,0
 All thing Nothing,0
 Always seem to get the small corner room when using booking com I may try a different site in future Front desk staff lacked a warm welcome There is no handrail to come out of the small bath shower facility very tricky No Positive,0

 No concessions on check out time Layout and location,0
No Negative The rooms were very clean and cozy the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was tasty and the location was great There were 7 of us in a group and we easily walked to the Eifel Tower the Louvre and the Christmas markets The metro stop was just a block away and easy to figure how to get to the Notre Dame Cathedral It was a wonderful stay with hassle free arrival and exit with the shuttle to and from CDG I would definitely stay there again ,1
 toilette has no ventilation no heating in the room the stupid breakfast was like 40 euros for two persons you can buy tones of food for that price  location,0
 When we left we asked the front desk for a taxi and thought we would be informed when the taxi arrived as we always do Therefore we just sat in the lobby and waited No one told us that we actually needed to stay outside and kept an eye on the taxi by ourselves We missed the taxi and it took 30 minutes until we finally got a drive We missed the train  Overall we are very satisfied with the stay The location is amazing and staff are generally helpful All deliveries to the front desk are well kept until we pick them up or they are sent properly to our room This is a great place to stay in Paris You enjoy the quietness while not being away from the main shopping visiting areas Bonus point I am a huge fan of Victor Hugo ,1
 Television was not good quality and remote didn t work though a replacement was sent to our room very quickly The bed was small and the pillows were lumpy and under filled We did not sleep well and this was a superior room One of the security personnel was extreme offensive stating that it was inappropriate for my partner to be in a particular room and even threatening to check out his identity Really out of order Breakfast not included despite high price  Mostly friendly staff but see minuses ,0
 Expensive Breakfast Room size Location ,1
 The room which I was apparently upgraded too was tiny and not big enough to open both suitcases at the same time The AC didn t cool enough and we had to get up 3 4 times at night to keep checking the cooling The breakfast was basic at best overall a very average experienceNo Positive,0

 Dirty noise and poor value for money Location,0
 Bedrooms are tired and in desperate need of refurbishment Room lighting is out of date and very and very dull compared to many other 5 star hotels across the globe Carpets are will worn Cooked breakfast very poor served on cold plates and by the time you have sat down to eat it it is cold Poor range of breakfast and poor lighting again I had to ask twice for mine to be cooked properly and warmed and by that time I had lost interest I wouldn t stay here again When I checked my credit card I was also charged 59 for 2 breakfasts that were included in my deal and had to claim a refund  location,0
 There were three of us in the room and friend of mine was arriving later Once she was at the reception she stated my name I was making the booking and hers in order to get the key and room number The staff member told her that there are no quests under this name and was quite rude after calling me numerous time I was at the spa she received the key I must stay the lady on check out was very friendly though  The room was spacious and quite clean the location is good,0
 Cant think of anything They have 4 bottles of wine for your consumption every day the location is amazing the staff is incredible I would stay here everytime ,1

 Nothing  Very quiet location Small and intimate hotel ,1
 Breakfast area smelled of all the cooking fresh eggs and bacon etc that was done there  Our room had a great view of London from the 8th floor breakfast was great Not like a usual english breakfast but like a great open buffet restaurant it was very good with wide selections for everyone ,1
 The hotel is very old and outdated The floor was dirty everything needed to be replaced as was far too old to be used by customers Showers were nasty in both rooms we had I didn t like the fact we were told to leave a good review on TripAdvisor  Location was ok as easy to walk to pubs food places Staff did make an effort to make a good impression Best area to stay if you are doing a Big Bus Tour This is the only reason why I have picked this hotel ,0
No Negative homely atmosphere with very nice friendly staff Quiet and comfortable Good wifi homely atmosphere,1
No Negative Horrible service,0
 When I booked the hotel it specifically said I would get a garden view I opened the curtains to a view of a concrete wall just a few feet away  The location was amazing Literally steps from the Metro stop and within walking distance of shops and restaurants The breakfast was delicious and had a bit of everything The bed was comfortable and our room was very clean ,1

"I stayed here the week of October -th, ---- for business and received a very warm and professional welcome by the front desk staff. The room was very nice and comfortable and the hotel was a mix of classical art deco with some updates, which could use some updates themselves. All way very satisfactory with the hotel and my stay until three days later when I received several fraud notices from American Express.It seems my card was compromised beginning the same day I checked into the hotel and I did not use the card anywhere since I checked in. Is it just a coincidence? Perhaps, but it seems very unlikely to me.",0
 wi fi signals were not strong  The place of the hotel was great at the heart of the city on mariahilfer street and just across the metro station there is a big market across the hotel the room was clean ,1
 The room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep If squeaked so much No Positive,0

 Two chambermaids one being male barged into our room after I had just got out of the shower and not yet dressed Room and particularly the bathroom was not cleaned anywhere close to what you expect from a hotel of this nature On one of the days our room was not even touched We had to ask to have it cleaned at 6pm  Our issues were attended to swiftly but the problem not resolved Bathroom cleanliness was shocking Reception staff were very efficient ,0
 Could do with a vending machine to buy snacks etc  Good location easy access to tube station,1
 But we are on the 8th floor top floor and the windows have gaps and strong winds blew into the room very cold in particular we have one bed next to the window The food in the restaurant is okay but not up to a four star hotel standard My son s fish fingers were under cooked  The room is quite spacious which I like ,0
 l Pretty expensive Have to pay to use the gym and pool Nothing around it I e shops cafes resturants Taxis are expensive to the centre from here and the tram takes about 40 mins Nice hotel Bed was amazing,0
 Late food was quite cumbersome to order and get and in addition quality and price does not fit with the rest of the hotel too bad  Excellent location inbetween of three underground stations 5 minute walk to Tower Bridge Small but nice room good value for money Excellent renovated bathroom Very nice staff and several amenities in the room make you feel welcomed They do have a bar which is open late for guests but not for outside people In addition several nice places are located within a few meters walking distance Can certainly recommend for staying ,1

"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Renaissance Chicago O'Hare on business, as we were attending a conference there. The room was clean and relatively spacious, but lacked many simple things, like a pad of paper, information about the hotel's amenities, a mirror with sufficient lighting to put on makeup, an envelope to use for tipping housekeeping, etc. I was disappointed that a Marriott hotel (which I usually enjoy) was so lacking in the basics.
On the plus side, the conference space was decent. 
Ultimately, I would not stay here on my own dime. It's convenient if you're just staying the night for a conference at the hotel, but isn't convenient for driving or walking to anything nearby (because there isn't anything nearby) and lacks the small details that make traveling easier.",0

 The mattress was so uncomfortable and caused a very sore back and tiredness which was not at all helpful for the business we were there for over the 2 days stay You should take a look at the the Premier Inn as I would rate their beds as being total comfort and 100 better than what we experienced at the Hilton and we were not the only ones with the same view point at breakfast this spoil t the Hilton experience for us and other guests we spoke to  location and friendly staff ,1

 Our rooms faced the road Terrible view and soo noisy I was woken every night several times by traffic and rowdy night clubbers returning home at 5 6am The sound proofing totally insufficient and the air con also very poor but we couldn t leave a window open as felt like we were sleeping next to the M25 Staff on reception and restaurants were top notch,0

"We decided to treat ourselves to a couple of nights in a good hotel to relax after the flight from England - what a mistake! The room was a small single, filled with a double bed over which you had to lift your cases to put them down. There was an empty condom packet on the floor and the lights didn't work. The restaurant staff spent our first breakfast arguing loudly in front of us and one of them tried to involve us in their dispute (we went out for breakfast on the second day!). We complained to reception at the time and left full details on their evaluation form but nobody seemed in the slightest bit interested - we didn't even get an apology, let alone an explanation or assurance our treatment had been unusual.

 Too big and impersonal and tries too hard to be trendy so much so that its almost trashy The foyer and passages fail to dazzle as does the room s cleanliness Traces of people before us was evident shower door dirty Only cleaned our room at 3 pm after we had phoned to ask when they would be there You have to show yourself to room nothing is explained from how things work to charges Very disappointing for what you pay  We made a mistake regarding location we should have remained in the centre so for us the beach was not a great choice but if this is what you want the location will be tops Sea view was lovely to wake up to The pool deck is fabulous and the service there is great ,0
 The room is not well isolated and everything was very loud You could hear the metro passing in the underground and all neighbours moving The room located in the 1st floor and at the street corner did make the stay very uncomfortable as you could hear everything on the street like being next to the people on the nearby terrace Very uncomfortable bathroom as you could not realise how much it could be seen from outside The room was superior only by the dimension otherwise a 3 room to raise it to a 4 standard some investments should be made By far too expensive for it s offering apart location  The hotel is very well located and staff is indeed friendly and helpful one can count on them Comfortable bed and clean bathroom,0

"Contrary to the -.- star rating that was listed for this property, I am writing to share my displeasure with my recent stay at the Crowne Plaza Columbus North. After driving over --- miles to spend a weekend in Columbus - the last thing that I wanted was a place that smelled like a nursing home, had dingy decor, was noisy, and overall depressing. There was hair in the bed, shower, and in the corners of the bathroom. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, and I opened my drapes to overlook a swamp. What?! I will never stay at a Crowne Plaza again. When I travel, I look for a refreshing experience where I can enjoy the property and its surroundings. This is certainly not such a place.",0

 The worst experience I had was with service of the concierge where they asked to carry my luggege on my departure because they said they do not have many people to help the guests of the hotel Besides some were mean with other guests together with some arrogant and mean receptionists they need close monitoring and follow up  The location and the facilities which provided some comfort and relaxation,0
 awful breakfast no variety at all You need to wait almost half an hour to get a decent piece of food even though there are only a few more people at the restaurant Worst breakfast experience in London ever The front desk staff s English pronunciation is bad There are far more elegant and luxurious hotels nearby for this value room toilet is too small Excellent location clean and good rooms,0
 Show fitting broken shower pressure too low the room was in the back of the hotel and dark No clean towels provided until asked for Noisy as could hear the doors closing along the corridor Late checkout was disproportionately expensive Breakfast expensive  the bed was very good All facilities provided in the room ,0
 Being in a disabled roomNo Positive,0
"The hotel is very nice, helpful front desk, attentive maid service, nice rooms. I would certainly stay again, but I save a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rating for truly exceptional places with special and-or unique features (eg waterfall showers). This hotel is very nice, but not extraordinary.",1

No Negative The rooms were lovely meticulously maintained sparkling clean The staff were friendly and made every effort to see we were happy Made our stay comfortable and made us feel welcome in Saint Germain Close to everything ,1
 The parking fee for guests is a bit high at 25 for 1 night and we went to check in at 16 30 pm to be told the room was not ready and so we didn t get into the room until about 5 15 pm which subsequently made us miss the first support act for Coldplay  Lovely spacious executive room on 10th floor so nice quiet with complimentary tea coffee hot chocolate water Kit Kats toiletries slippers dressing gowns The cooked breakfasts were lovely and was served to us in our room for a 5 tray charge and it was delivered on time The shower was spacious and powerful and we would definitely stay there again ,1
 Sound proofing with the adjacent room wasn t perfect but also not a big deal  The front desk staff made us feel at home in Paris very friendly and helpful when we found out that our outgoing flight to Poland was at a different airport 1 5 hours away Location was near everything Louvre etc but also super quiet Perfect for a good night s sleep after a redeye ,1
 The location is in the middle of the financial district which is away from all the fun places in town Be prepared to travel to other parts of town for late night dinner or alike  Quiet and clean the staff is very helpful ,1
 Small double bed squeezed into a small room Location great for me,1
 Lack of coffee top up in room Extremely rude concierge Quality of room,0
"Sheraton Suites charges $-- per day and per device to access the internet from your room. So, if you are traveling with your family - kids and are carrying a couple of laptops - XBox - iPod touch or Nintendo DS you will need to add $----- per day. A real nightmare. 
In addition, the last time I stayed the TVs were not working, they changed one of the TV and still had problems. The same movie appeared three times charged in my bill and had to spend -- minutes at checkout ( I was in a hurry) to correct the mistake. 
A bad place.",0

 Room was awful  Location,0
 Standard room was dingy too much dark brown furniture and flooring and the red leatherette sofa bed was threadbare The view from the window was awful with barely a view of the sky Room was very stuffy with winter duvets The hotel entrance was not actually on the street indicated in the details The breakfast was outrageously expensive even for Vienna It was very close to a u Bahn station although this was not made clear in the hotel details Bathroom was very clean,0
No Negative The location is excellent just a few steps away from the subway We could see the Rathus directly from window Plus the room is super comfortable Really recommend for visitors to Vienna ,1
"Recently went on a three week road trip along the west coast of America. Stayed here for - nights, and whilst it was the most expensive place we stayed, it certainly wasn't the best value for money. 
The room we had was large and clean, comfortable beds and nice separate living area. However the street noise was amazingly loud. I would recommend requesting a room on one of the top floors. The breakfast was very sparse - a choice of melon or muffins. The afternoon crackers and cheese was nice but the wine was disgusting. Whilst the wifi was free, the signal was almost non-existant and we often had to go down to reception just to be able to get a stronger signal.
If we'd paid less for the room we would have been impressed but it just wasn't worth the money, the hotel has certainly seen better days.",0
No Negative Not worth the money,0
 room right next to heliport pad  Lovely room appreciated upgrade,1
"Hotel is in its renovation, so you may feel noisy. Room is spacious as Drury’s manner.

 The room very old and the clean was not goodNo Positive,0
 Haven t seen a hotel without a tooth paste and tooth brush before The room was smaller that we expeced althoug it looked larger on a picture so bear it in mind  The location is good breakfast is fresh and nice although the selection is not very good ,0
 Restaurant menu was bizarre Risotto was definitely microwaved as the temperature of it was at a level that you only get from a microwave  They moved me to another room which I actually regretted because it was tired in comparison to the disabled room I just find disabled rooms clinical lacking that homely feel ,0

"One of the first things that impressed me about the Econolodge here in Dallas is how dedicated the establishment appears to be in celebrating the economic and ethnic diversity of our great country. Secondly, one can hardly complain about the location, nestled as it is against the John Carpenter Freeway, rendering an ease of freeway access that other hostelries can only hope to emulate.",0

They advertise rooms renovated recently, wall paper was coming off wall in restroom and exaust fan did not work, this was the second room they sent us too, the first one the bathroom floor was full of water, why did not the maid staff let someone know? Whirlpool is closed and who knows for how long for renovations to the exercise room. Beds and linens were good. Rooms just need a bit of sprucing up.",0
 The room was terrible An underground room in the basement with a cold draught Half a window overlooking rubbish and trash I increased temperature and it didn t work Had to walk to reception to ask for help as phone was not working and nobody turned up to help with heating or phone There was hardly wifi and reception and I had to stand up aginst the window for signals I couldn t speak to colleagues to find out where they were It wasn t a good experience I asked for a refund and was told to speak to booking com I left 3hours later to a neighbouring hotel  nothing,0
 The hotel was advertised as within close proximity of the o2 arena Although the website states it is 0 8 miles from the o2 arena this is as the crow flies and across the Thames To walk to the arena is an hour and a half walk or 20 in a taxi The shower had very low water pressure and did not maintain a temperature The flush on the toilet did not work The maid knocked on our door at 10 30 and started shouting leaving Leaving Whilst we were trying to get dressed for check out at 11am No Positive,0
 Bathroom could be a bit bigger Rooms are at the ground floor due to this no good city view of course but we did not missed it really Good views are enough available in the city itself  Reception Team very friendly and with good Tips regarding Amsterdam Thanks Rooms are new and very comfortable 20 25min beautiful walk to the city center also renting a bike is possible and also a metro just before the hotel available Room had a TV a safe and a water boiler and also some books to read Breakfast was fine only a bit more sweets and muesli then 5stars Parking place directly at the hotel 17 50 24h ,1

 The 6am fire alarm lol but your staff where A1 informed about situation and strangely a comfort to know our safety was cared for Reguarding fire alarm going off exit out of the building was clearly marked making it an easy quick exit  Location Exellent staff couldn t be more helpfull all in all an Exellent hotel staff Frank Isle of Man,1
 I don t recommend the hotel restaurant not great food for high prices one 75 cl bottle of sparkling water 6 50  The hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable It is isolated from the town center but you can get there in 35 40 minutes with tram 2 With the same tram you get to the main museum in 15 minutes ,1
 There is no pool just plunge pool and it is not marked on your advertisement only on the hotel website The hotel is old furnichure scratched Bath rusty Breakfast good enough,0
 Staff rude and never around Slow service in all dining rooms Thin mattress Even when you say your going to leave as unhappy they just let you leave All in all awful experience and I would advise others not to stay No Positive,0

 My wife didn t like the very small tomb like lift with an outer door She took the stairs  The whole concept of the hotel was lovely The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms although small as it is an old hotel were just fitting Overall we had a lovely stay and I would definitely stay there again as it is in a good location for around the BBc and Harley Street ,1
 Very bad Value for money is like a 3 stars No Positive,0
"We had a clean average sized room - but we wanted a room with - queens plus a bathtub which meant they charged us --dollars per night extra - if you want a lakeview room you will have to pay -- dollars per night.
We faced the air conditioners but not too bothered as we rarely spent any time in the room
Hotel is beautifully decorated and very convenient to the art institute, millenium park and local transport links
If you like power showers, the rain shower is not for you!
All staff were helpful and polite",0
 A bit dated but fine A good basic transit hotel Great breakfast loved the fresh orange juice ,1

 The restaurant was closed for renovation and although the hotel had sent me at least 3 emails prior to my stay this was not mentioned Breakfast had to be taken in a hotel next door Swiss Hotel No Positive,1
 Stuff not helpful i forgot somthing in the room when I ve checkout they didn t help me to find it Location,0
 We didn t have breakfast as 25 per person seemed too dear  The location simply could not be any better and although the decor is a little tired the hotel was very clean and excellent value for money ,1
 Rooms are really small and I missed having some entertainment channels Food is a bit expensive  Great location gets the job done ,1
No Negative Bed very comfy staff so nice food delicious at breakfast loved the pool,1
 There is a 50 deposit you have to put down when you check in that you get back when you check out This is not stated anywhere on booking com s page for the hotel  The best bed I ve ever slept in hands down The shower and bathroom facilities were on point and the view from the window was fantastic The staff were lovely and attentive and the wifi was super fast The hotel is located right by Arena Boulevard for Amsterdam s concert venues ,1

 Poor standard for 365 no minibar old fashion out to date room  Exelent location,0
 They advertise that they have pool facilities but there is a charge to use it Staff are not happy there it was my birthday and we were happy to have a few drinks from the fridge when we arrived the fridge was left open and all drinks were hot we asked for an ice bucket because and they came back with a really small one we asked for another one they didn t even made an effort to come back to us Wouldn t apologize or offer to change for cold drinks they just didn t care  Location is amazing and lovely balcony in the rooms easy to find everything ,1
 The place was very bad Had to pay extra 60 pounds unplanned for a room with window The place is not clean flies everywhere I cannot sleep and my colleague was not happy with me choosing the room Staffs not receptive at all Highly disappointed Wanted to cancel but it was too late  nothing,0
 Beds are too hard front desk staff do not seem to communicate between shifts we thought we had things arranged with one only to be told by the next shift that there were no arrangements or tickets at our departure time only to find out after the event that arrangements were made so we missed our event  Location was great ,0
 The cost of breakfast 19 95 for a full English very expensive My bed creaked every time I moved The ferry to Canary Wharf The room,1
 That I didn t stay longer The only negative which really wasn t a big deal at all was that the paint on the doors in the room was peeling and or missing This could be updated but other than that nothing negative  The staff went out of their way to make our stay absolutely amazing They were all incredibly friendly and were so helpful in organizing anything we wanted It was my birthday and they brought us flowers and chocolates and waved our room service charges Absolutely so much more than we ever expected Made us feel like absolute royalty ,1
"We received a free stay at this hotel. Not worth a free stay we left. Smelled of mold, carpets dirty and throughout the day homeless with their beer bottles and skateboarders in the parking lot. Why they call it a resort is beyond me. The freeway is feet away. We let. Would not recommend",0
 Small rooms you barley can reach the other side of the bed Location,0
 Parents while their stay 4 nights experienced problems with shower as well as deposit box safe wasn t working For both issues staff was contacted twice however no solution provided Generally didn t feel like 4 star hotel Also though booking com shows euro as hotel currency cost amount was taken by the hotel in usd Booking confirmation prior arrival was asked to be amended to add missing passport details instead of providing electronically edited version the details were added by thick marker and sent scanned version I consider it not professional and again not 4 hotel service Good location nice breakfast comfortable bed,0
 The room was very hot when I arrived The sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective The inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows I asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was I assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while I was out However they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night Made for a poor nights sleep No Positive,0
 The area around the hotel was less than desirable The restaurant attached to the hotel was over priced Italian and not very good the food are near buy were not appealing  Ultra modern facility inside Able to check in early durig the day and get into our room ,0
 however I was not aware that my room would be so small and in the basement of the hotel There were no photos of such small rooms on website Main area inc reception lovely and reflective of photos ,0
 first if the toilet is important to you do not come to this hotel second the cleaning is not well services is not good comparing to price location,0
 The hotel had no hot water for 2 days the first day I reported the problem and waiting 3 hours for them to resolve he problem which never got resolved I then had to have a cold shower as I was lossing my holiday time the following morning the same problem not hot water again the people on the desk were not help full at all everyone I spoke to gave me a different answer to there problem I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Amsterdam you would get better service else we re don t waste ur time or money on this hotel Rude staff and no hot water  Worst trip I ve ever had to Amsterdam I ve stayed in over 20 hotels in the city and never had such a bad time as when I stayed here ,0
 The receptionists are very slow and not very helpful  The location it s handy right in front to the central station but at night time it s not nice and safe area The hotel is very new and has got a nice view Very silent with soundproof glasses The shower products are very very nice and the beds super confy ,1
 The single room was VERY cramped The breakfast choice and actual food was really excellent but friends complained about the food pizza they had in the evening,0
 Their licence to serve alcohol had been revoked some time ago This needs to be made clear before people book  Breakfast menu was extensive and good quality ,0
 Nothing to dislike location is not central but then the rates are so reasonable one simply cannot complain We had a car so location didn t bother us but for others this could be a hindrance  Clean very comfortable and spacious rooms parking was sufficient staff are nice and helpful ,1
 Every thing else Just the location,0
No Negative The overall place was perfect and the staff is very helpful Close to public transport stores restaurants Easy to find in a very good neighborhood ,1
 No glasses in the room only one coffee cup after calling reception they told me to get glasses myself at the bar Not the service you would expect in a hotel like this When we got back early in the morning a mouse walked on the couch in the lobby  Location not too far from Westergasfsbriek ,0
No Negative They were charging even for the breakfast which I consider a basic service ,0
 Rooms are tiny Great restaurants near by,0
 The Air conditioning was not available despite the warm temperatures some staff were not too keen to answer questions theRe was no room service or any form of catering after 11pm my personal gym in my house is better equipped than the sorry one in the hotel  Centrally located not far from the airport Camp Nou stadium and other beautiful attractions ,0
 The facts and websites introduction are slightly different For example their website said that most of their rooms have shower bathtub but it isn t true The staff told me that only the family room has a bathtub Moreover the website also said that they provide toiletries but they only have shampoo and conditioners no body wash Last but not least I wrote to them asked for a room with a bathtub they replied yes but when I got there they provided me with a room without a bathtub Which was disappointing and annoying  The breakfast is nice and the bed is comfortable The wi fi is stable and fast The location is great only 5 minutes walk to the station ,0
 The hotel was quite run down in need of refurbishment No springs left in the chairs in the dining room Fittings generally out dated  Nothing to mention specifically ,0
 The food served by the Novotel restaurant was well below average No Positive,0
No Negative This is the second time for me in this hotel it s near metro The staff specially receptionMarcel is so helpful dedicated and friendly l r ecommended this hotel it s comfortable,1
 Nothing  Nice hotel close to metro station pleasant staff Breakfast was extraordinary ,1
 The air conditioner in the room was a joke was just blowing some air even at the lowest temperature leaving me hot Watch out if you are travelling in summer Some of the check in staff could be trained better to deal with customers Not to mean they were rude but not very friendly either  Perfect location in the city but not in a crowded area Clean rooms and bathrooms Good breakfast Kids play options Xbox Wii and other options on the ground floor reception area Shopping mall across the road with a number of restaurants Gym small but good equipment ,1
 Not worth the money I paid for 2 rooms the same price but one was tiny with no view 623 Other room 621 was much bigger with a nice view Felt short changed on the one room  Good location Ncp very close and secure ,0
No Negative Great staff wish I could afford to come back here all the time,1
 For the rate of the room I thought it would have been bigger Whilst it was incredible the room itself didn t have an abundance of floor space despite booking a Superior Double  The hotel went to an extra effort to put on some food and drink requested before check in so I could surprise my boyfriend Wonderful The room was gorgeous and real luxury and the location couldn t have been more perfect for our weekend excursions ,1
No Negative Location restaurant service ambiance superb ,1
 very small roomsNo Positive,0
 Sound proofing on the windows could be better But I expect some street noise in London  The staff were all very welcoming and helpful throughout my stay The food both at breakfast and in the bar was great ,1
 Air conditioning hard to set Flush buttons of toilet sometimes stuck so filling water continued running  Spacious and bright room very close to Gloucester Road underground Quiet room but could hear some rumble of underground Many nice choices at breakfast buffet Definitely will be our first choice hotel on next stays in London ,1
 A traditional British hotel loved by all has been modernised to be less than than satisfactory It has little or no character and might just as well be a block of Service Apartments rather than a hotel in one of the nicest parts of London  Location is great as is the bar ,0
 Construction noise from next door resulting in moving to a smaller less attractive room given the inconvenience I would have expected an equal or better room given the class of hotel Disappointing  Clean functional rooms,0
 Jacuzzi didn t worked expensive bar at the top of the roof very crowded hotel I did like the pool at 19 th floor and yoga class at morning with the view,0

 Location Cleanliness restaurantNo Positive,1
 Were given a small room with five coat hangers for a 4 night stay where the bathroom door hit the toilet when opened Asked for a different room and had a much better room 3 doors away Why give away the small poor rooms first Was it because we weren t Italian The bar and lounge blended into each other from the reception area with no atmosphere whatsoever Consequently we went out every night  There was nothing about this hotel that we really liked although it was only a short walk from lovely restaurants after turning right out of the hotel Attached photos are of the lounge and breakfast area ,0
No Negative The staff could not have been more attentive The location could not be better ,1
 Pillows too soft  Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful Breakfast choice was good ,1
 Small room limited floor space Requested a balcony and got one room decorated to celebrate our anniversary,1
 the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only 1 6 m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above  location quite good next to two underground stations very nice to stroll through the park in the morning evening the staff is friendly the breakfast is quite nice and diverse but not included in your booking for its price you can find lots of options in the city ,0
 Very noisy at night the hotel has a restaurant that stays open and play loud music until 2am making impossible to rest we had to exchange room at 2am Elevators were broken at check in and check out 5 floors up and down No AC only heater No kingsize bed it was 2 single beds united not comfortable Shower design is terrible it s very small and open and the bathroom floor is always soaked due this poorly layout Hotel was in maintenance in the morning again making impossible to rest due noise Horrible experience would not recommend it  Good location and next to the metro Good decoration and good space in room Staff is friendly ,0
 Staff poor and I still have not recieved a refund from the stay do not stay here They just want your cash  Location was good,0
 First of all the room is very small There was hardly place for a bed and the bathroom was very small as well Thereby it didn t look like the pictures on the site Furthermore the included breakfast is poor as well we expected at least a basic English breakfast but even that was not the case Also the room was quite noisy and the friendliness of the staff decreased when the night falls Overall the value for money is very poor For this price one may expect a lot better  The location was good ,0
 We were told that there was a problem with the room so were moved to the Shaftesbury Metropolis Hotel as no other rooms were available Despite also being 4 the Metropolis is a lower quality hotel Won t trust Park Grand hotels again No Positive,0
 It was all good Fabulous location and one of the comfiest beds in London Room was small but very well appointed it was great that they had a really good heating airconditioning system that you could control in the room The hotel had a lot of beautiful character about it much more so than the usual large hotel chains ,1
 Small room Good location,1
 The staff seemed a bid cold and aloof  Immaculately clean hotel well maintained and the breakfast was out of this world ,1
 It was under restorationNo Positive,1
No Negative Friendly staff in particular the receptionist Bally Room was very spacious and clean And great breakfast at Jamie s Italian ,1
No Negative Still within walking distance to the centre Nice and clean comfortable beds parking garage next to the hotel,1

"Came to town to celebrate my --th birthday. Checked in, was told one of my two rooms was not available. First room we entered was dirty, had not been service by housekeeping. Second room we tried had water leaking from the ceiling. The elevator was broke, and one of my guests just had knee replacement surgery. We finally got some half-decent rooms. Rooms were super hot! tv's didn't work. towels were dingy. burn holes in blankets and around window sills. I felt like i walked into a nightmare, a boarding house, one step up from a hostel! 
THe desk clerk was a joke. (I happen to work for a choice hotel as a desk clerk) Rude, miserable, unprofessional. I wanted a solution, not to listen to this girl complain.",0
We stayed at your facilities on ---- thru ----. We have to check out immediately in the morning finding out that my children we bite by bed bugs. This place is loud. We have our neighbors slamming the door next to us. The front desk was not helpful at all.,0
 Noisy room due to most probably plumbing issues We knew every time the neighbour in the next room visited his her bathroom Our bathroom extremely small Uncomfortable for two people No Positive,0
 Rooms were drab and bed and pillows very uncomfortable Definitely not what you would call a 5 star maybe an average 3 star At breakfast the bacon was half cooked and the eggs were cold On the whole very poor value for money  Loved the location right across the road from Libertys and Carnaby Street A five minute walk from Oxford Street ,0

 It wasn t so clean I find a pubic hair on the bathroom door it was disgusting I paid 16 just to order a pizza margherita at the reception so crazy There is poor light in the room I had to use the bathroom light to find some stuff in my luggage  The staff is kind beyond expectations The room is nice They accept pets They called me a taxi Excellent location close to the Gare de Lyon station ,1
 Bed was like a brick pillows flat room had not been decorated since the 80 s Electric heater on floor bathroom dirty  Close to Hyde park for winter wonderland got discounted rate which was a fair reflection of the room quality ok for one sleepless night ,0

"A great week-long experience began with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Preston"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at the front desk, a very helpful and friendly gentleman! The hotel lobby and rooms are very nice and clean (get a room with a view over Connecticut Ave), and fresh coffee in the lobby is always on. Parking is safe, easy and free and the Metro is a block away allowing very convenient travel anywhere throughout the district. Numerous resturants and grocery-drug store are a block away. Within a few blocks is Dupont Circle and-or Wisconsin Ave with many resturants and high-end shopping. Rock Creek Park, a great """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""natural area"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" operated by the National Park Service is a few blocks down Military Ave. At less than half of hotels deeper into the city and still very convenient to everywhere via the metro, I'll be back everytime I have business in DC.",1
 Poky room corner of corridor on stairs creaky floorboards no hot water in afternoon evening for showers and sporadic aircon Overall a disappointing experience by comparison to previous experience there b4 Xmas 2015 Location,0
 The hotel itself is actually not the nice Victorian red brick building in the photos but a modern build attached to the side of it Rooms are pretty awkward There were only 2 sockets in the whole apartment and one was so close to the desk you couldn t plug anything into it The area was noisy And despite advice saying you could park nearby all day for 7 this turned out to be untrue The location of the hotel is quite far away from a tube station so the cheaper room price was probably negated by the extra bus tube fares and long stay parking cost Breakfasts were also pretty poor  The rooms were a generous size And although the neighbourhood was busy and noisy there were some interesting shops and stalls around ,0
 I loved staying however I guess with the hotel being ao central in London the prices were sky high Valur for money in Manchester what I paid would have got me a suite rather than a standard room My only quibble  Such a wonderful hotel D i was apprehensive about how the rooms would feel look after a few images on the internet made them look a bit bare however they were warm comforting and luxurious Gorgeous hotel ,1

 We had two rooms on floor 2 and 5 The one on the second floor was quite dark I also don t understand why Design and boutique hotel usually equals bathroom toilet with glass walls and door Okay it wasn t see through but a little privacy would be nice Also there is no place where to hang towels to dry The location of the hotel was really good and the rooms were clean and had enough space for 3 adults Really handy that the toilet and the shower were separate Passeig de Gracia with the shopping street was in a walking distance there were also a lot of nice restaurants nearby ,1

Weather was great which made everything seem even better.
Would love to go back to NY and would definitely stay at The Hilton again.",1
 We arrived at 1 and was told that checking in started at 2 and to come back then Upon arriving at 2 we were told our room was ready However after complaining about the inconvenience the manager upgraded our room free of charge good service Upon checking in I was told there would be a 100 deposit to be taken I was not made aware of this prior to my visit Staff and facilities were brilliant room was clean and really well laid out everything you needed nearby ,1

amenities in the hotel are good. toilets are clean and the room is comfortable. internet was workin fine and the morning breakfast was decent .

"The remodeled rooms at this location are really nice for a Motel -. So just stay in your room and lock the door because the rest of the experience isn't great. The front desk clerk was completely overwhelmed and there was a line of people waiting for rooms to be cleaned so that we could check in. There is a strip joint next door and the hotel shuttle only runs - ---, so if you have an early flight like i did you need to call a cab. It's ok for an airport layover.",0
run from this hotel. room stunk. no refund for roomstays. be careful who you book with?????,0

 The housekeeping at the hotel was quite bad When we asked the reception to make sure the beds were made properly they simply left us a new set of sheets on the bed and dirty laundry on the floor Very disappointing  The property was very conveniently located just 100 m from the Raspail metro station The room size and facilities were quite comfortable for 3 people ,0
 Our room was not available when we arrived to check in at 3pm even though check in is 2pm The receptionist told us they were busy that day I didn t see why them being busy meant they couldn t have our room ready in time for check in Also this is the first time I have stayed at a UK hotel with no tea and coffee making facilities You can but a tea or coffee there for around 3 each but you can t make one in the room  Good location for our evening at the Albert Hall ,0
 Bed uncomfortable springs First room we were given had a sewage smell and we asked to be moved which they did with no problem  location and view,0
"This is a very basic hotel, nothing fancy, so if you are out most of the time, I feel this hotel is good enough. Very very helpful and friendly staff. They don't have a porter, but they do provide a luggage trolley for you to bring your bags to your room or during check out. On the first day, the valet guy helped us with the bags, they are helpful, if you need help, they do try to help you. They don't provide bottled water, but they have a ice and (beverage) vending machine outside the room. Lobby as well, they sell drinks, cup noodles and snacks.",0
No Negative Outstanding location Virtually on the steps of St Pauls Cathedral Brasserie next door very well priced and decent food Like the water cooler and bottles in the hallway ,1
 REALLY noisy Thumping music until way beyond 2am considerable street noise and smell of dope in the room Room had one of these awful glass walled toilets meaning you had zero privacy from your room mate at the times you need it most Breakfast was ok but not great basically a small selection of sausage scrambled egg roast cherry tomato and potato plus assorted croissants yoghurts They also were very busy and we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table Certainly not worth 25 euro per person per day Overall a real and genuine disappointment considering we spent something like 800 euro on two nights here Dont repeat our mistake No Positive,0
No Negative Everything was as always amazing,1
 The payment was deducted from my debit card before I arrived which was not pay later as I thought it was Secondly there is a damp smell when you enter the lobby Also the bed covers are not appealing Very well located in the city centre making it easy to visit the areas of interest,0
 On this occasion as it was NYE and I was staying with a friend who had a separate room at the Strand I stayed in a single room for 170 which is over priced when it s usually 120 for a double Never the less I couldn t fault the hotel at all  Everything at The Strand is perfect I always stay there when in London as the location is fantastic and the staff are wonderful ,1

 We asked for a change of room as the first one had a horrible smell impossible to stay in we had a few drinks in the pub at the hotel and the pricing was very expensive A very busy hotel but it was surprisingly quiet during the night time,0
 We were disappointed with the executive suite very small window opened out on to the service yard not at all executive The room service was VERY poor It took three attempts to get the basics of a very simple order any where near correct We ordered a Afternoon Tea which was supposed to consist of a selection of sandwiches and cakes along with cream scones and strawberry preserve we got two scones and cream no preserve no knifes no milk when eventually preserve was brought it was marmalade at which stage we just gave up There was a lot of noise throughout the night people running up and down the corridor and slamming doors  The lady on reception was friendly,0
My family and I stayed here as part of a tour of three cities including New York !!!! and this hotel was the middle part of our trip. The room was as described in another review tatty and not very clean and that best describes the room we were given. Our room also backed onto the service delivery area where not only did we hear traffic we also had no view and staff wandering past intermittently meant that we had to keep the curatins. The staff at breakfast hovered when it came close to --.-- ie closing time at --am awaiting the check being cleared thankfully the kids ate free but this was more expensive that in San Diego where we later stayed. The location is the best thing about this hotel and thats it !!!!,0
No Negative Breakfast was lovely Cookies and water in the room were a lovely touch as well Staff were super friendly and even though we were early arriving there was no problem checking in early ,1
 The first room given had a very bad smell I used half of my spray perfume left the room to have dinner but smell was still there afterwards The Staff graciously transferred us to an equivalent room However the room was not cleaned the following day and the towels were not changed Good and helpful staff specially the Filipino named Christopher and an older person from India,0
 Could only pay for the restaurant food on card not in cash which was not appropriate for us  Lovely room such good value for money would definitely recommend Staff are extremely helpful and buses run a 2 minute walk away that go into the city centre There is a petrol station right next door which sells food so is very convenient 10 10,1
 From the reception to the hotel staff they all look harassed and they take it out on the guest They are not friendly always rude I regretted my stay at this hotel it s a place i will never return to and I don t think I can recommend this hotel to anyone worst of all was the manager who was very harsh towards me and even went as far as insulting my person  The hotel and the location is fine,0

 The lower ground bedroom was extremely noisy which made it difficult to sleep The floor above the room creaked very loudly when people walked about and I could hear every word spoken by people in the room next door The shower box was uncomfortably small  I did not like it,0
 The receptionists are not professional their English is not very good and are not welcoming One thing that I didn t liked in the room is that I don t understand at this price and with a coffee machine in the room why they don t give every day some capsules for coffee I ve had two nights accommodation and one coffee for each 2 adults It s a shame you need to look at that machine and not to have coffee to make one Or maybe you need to ask for some and pay extra  I like The location Is brilliant I ve had an executive twin room which was very nice and enough room for two adults and 1 child very good equipped and the bed was very comfy Everything was very clean I also liked the personal from breakfast ,1

"Standard Ramada-style venue - this chain is hit & miss.
This one is a bit far versus the other Ramada nearby SEA airport and highways.
Rates were lower and it may be why – there’s a “weird” zone between the airport and this hotel.
Room was OK – nothing wrong to say.
There’s a shuttle bus from the airport (we rented a car).
Front desk staff was friendly.
There’s a basic but OK breakfast – even bananas.
There’s a computer and printer – that’s rare with the Wyndham chain.",1

But the views... the views make up for it all. Tip: wake up early and watch the sun rising over Central Park. Unforgettable.",0
"Good location, walking distance to Hollywood Blvd. (star bucks half a block walk ) quick drive to Universal and Warner Brothers. 
Room was slightly worn, but expected due to age and location, continental breakfast was not up to par compared to other Days Inn I have stayed at.

 Window screwed closed Good breakfast,0
 We d been travelling around Europe for six months and this was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at Perhaps our expectations were too high but this hotel was far from being good value for money The room was large enough but even though there was a cubicle for it there was no fridge so if you wanted to have a cold drink you had to buy it from the hotel The wardrobe was barely eight inches wide The lounge chairs were the formwork type and there was no table to go with them The workbench for computers had only one chair Perhaps this hotel is just indicative of how little you get for your money in London  The location was good two tube stations nearby and a relatively easy walk to the main attractions ,0
 Personal thing I hated the shower which drowned you in water and wasn t directable  Modern clean hotel with excellent staff,1

It was very close to Chinatown and Union Square with the Wharf relatively close (---ish minute walk). The actual hotel was nice. The rooms were tiny, but they were very clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and the wireless internet was excellent. They have three computers in the lobby with internet-printers, a nice gym and a little observation deck at the top floor with a view of the San Fran skyline. Room service was very nice and the front desk staff were professional and very accomodating. The front desk staff is excellent, and went out of their way to help me when I had a sticky situation. When I return, I will definately be staying there again!",1

No Negative Definitely not a 4 star hotel I d say 3 stars Very well located rooms are small and a little old Room I was staying at didn t even have a shower small bath tub a normal person can t fit in Breakfast was average only worth it if already included Bed was very comfortable and staff was nice ,1

No Negative Wonderful experience good location and friendly front desk,1
 Location Prefer the Westminster area this area is way to busy Not good customer service We purchased breakfast for our two mornings which was like being in a cattle cafeteria Tried to cancel our second day and they would not refund the money Poor customer service for an expensive hotel Would not stay again The decor,0
 Overall I had a terrible experience here as I had my purse stolen from the hotel reception while collecting my luggage There is no security whatsoever everyone can come in and out of the reception from the street and while the location is convenient close to the train station it is also one of the rougher areas of Paris so some form of security is a must Some ideas have someone supervising the door at the very least and a door that stays closed unless someone buzzes you in  The room was standard for a budget hotel ,0
 Ordered room service drinks which were not cleaned from the room for our whole stay Very disappointed with this  Nice room and clean bathrooms Reception staff were very friendly and helpful ,0
No Negative Good location good restaurants close by ,1
 Price was high Noisy street  Close to the metro station,0

 Too noisy and small Location,0
 Again only complaint is for mattresses  This was second time here the same felling like a year before ,1
 the hallways smelt like poop the elevator smelt like lavender and the room service didn t replace the nespresso caps or coffee during the stay  the location was mostly good,0
 Nothing It was well situated near to tube and restaurants Very nice and clean friendly staff ,1
 near tram rails a bit noisy in the morning a good hotel clean and cozy,1
 Although the noise from the street was pretty much inaudible the soundproofing between my room and the next could have been better  excellent breakfast choice,1
"The front desk staff was friendly. The room was covered in mold, bathroom and by AC. Wall paper was falling off. This was in tower B which we later figured may have been because of roof pool. They changed our room without difficulty to the other tower which was OK though still had loose wallpaper and a slight mildew smell behind TV. The building is really old and has horrible elevators which stop constantly even though no one is waiting. Parking was convenient and reasonable. Wifi barely worked. I wish I had just spend the extra and booked another hotel.",0
 Bathroom could do with review of shower facility over bath type shower with a drench head and has a curtain which is not a wrap around but allows water to seep out Friendly atmosphere comfortable room and good breakfast,1

 road construction literally outside and the galleria was also being refurbished can easily miss this place while searching for it really good for solo travellers would i bring my family hrmmm maybe not much of a choice in the continental breakfast do not have own restaurant for lunch  super close to the shopping areas Duomo di Milano the staff is not too bad don t smile as much as I would like them to but really good enough for me to ask them questions with decent answers returning the porter is very helpful and responsible i did not have to carry the room keys around and there was a safety box in the room located in a galleria snugged away quietly from the main street nice people working in the breakfast place ,1
 The reception I call the hotel for booking and he said it was full and no available rooms I checked it through website booking and I made the booking No Positive,0
 Shwer had no power and made an awful screeching sound when turned on  The hotel was fine apart from the shower However the room was no better than what you would have got with a cheaper hotel for 60 in the same area ,0
 For a really expensive room 380 there was not so much as a bottle of water or fridge with drinks OK so there was a kettle and tea and coffee but nothing else I took two clients to the restaurant ordered and after about 45 minutes enquired about the delay in service They has actually LOST the order and we waited another 1 2 hour In fact we arrived at 8 00pm and we were finally served at 9 30pm and this has the Hilton name Service was so bad the manager of the restaurant didn t charge us but I was VERY embarrassed  Room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom ,0
 No complimentary tea or coffee Bed,0

"This is a great hotel - nice people, great service. They remember you whenever you return, even if it's been a year. The rooms are small, but beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are super.Wonderful location and the European smallness appeals to me.",1
 We re 3 adults but we took an extra bed for 50 night because there were not 3 single beds as the reciptionest told us it was two twin beds attached together which is not suitable for three people to sleep together because there is no mattress filling the gap inbetween the the beds Unfriendly receptionists Pool location ATM and friendly bellboy and room cleaners,1

 We were visiting Milan as part of our honeymoon requested an early check in 5 months before arriving received confirmation of this However on arrival at 12 midday we were told our room was not ready We were placed in the only available room which was noisy next the the lift was small was not a 4 standard and had a terrible smell from the drains in the bathroom As there were no other rooms available we could not swap Fortunately we only stayed one night The hotel seems over priced for what it actually offers was disappointing as it was part of our honeymoon  The location to the main square was good The roof top bar had a great view of the city and the staff up there were very friendly We had a pasta dish which was fresh tasty ,0
 The worst room I ve ever had in Paris Dirty Tiles in bathroom were falling off bugs in the tub water damage on the ceiling and outside our room Dirty walls Absolutely gross and overpriced The staff was rude and downright mean I would never stay here again and advise everyone to steer clear of this tourist trap I come to Paris multiple times a year there are so many wonderful hotels for the same price point where the staff is actually lovely and helpful AVOID AT ALL COSTS Do not eat the breakfast Just gross all around  NOTHING,0
"I've stayed in many NYC hotels during business trips over the past -- years, and after my first trip to Morgans, it is my new favorite. The staff was wonderful -- friendly, helpful and not the least bit haughty. I had a basic room and it was plenty big, tastefully appointed, and completely comfortable and quiet. The continental breakfast was terrific -- as many of my favorite things as I cared to eat. All-in-all this was a great retreat from the hectic pace of my business trip. Morgans is big enough that I felt secure, yet small enough that I felt well cared for. I am eager to return.",1

Guest service was impressive. Rooms were beautiful. Location fantastic.",1
 This is not a five star hotel It is like my grandmother old tired and the best is behind her No Positive,0
I stayed at the Loews Denver in November ----. I was disappointed when I entered my room. I had expected higher quality linens. I was also disappointed in the service (for a --star). I wanted to see a movie and was told they were out of newspapers. I asked them if they could find the times for me and they gave me a phone number to call myself. I thought the restuarant and valet were excellent. I think you could stay in a lower-rated and lower-priced hotel and get better service.,0
 The location was not convenient from the airport train station or sightseeing  Rooms were very clean ,0
 A very loud air conditioning system Uncomfortable shower  The location staff and design,1
No Negative Always love this hotel so keep coming back great service location nice rooms parking etc ,1
 Hotel undergoing renovation very little public space just one quite noisy bar and a library lounge which opens only for afternoon tea shut by 6pm Renovations not acknowledged no apology or info in when these would end what would be improved The sauna is separate male female within the pool changing rooms Also a long walk the length of County Hall to our room  Lovely room and bathroom Excellent location Nice bar with view to Westminster There is a 25m swimming pool ,1
 We might waiting for the room several hours inspite of confirmation to receive our notes about early arrival The window of the room was in the ground floor in a covered parking gate without any direct views of open air Extremly loud corridors with not effective proofing  I have tried to be this hotel with positive attitude but unfortunatelly this hotel is a trap ,0

 We paid for an upgrade to full English breakfast and it really was horrible Very greasy and not well cooked I couldn t eat it They also charged 12 for four coffees which would normally be served as part of a 20 breakfast price They took the price of these coffees and the breakfast upgrade cost off our bill which was good But I would have preferred to have a lovely breakfast There where some bottles of water next to the coffee machine in the room I presumed they would be complimentary but they were not This wasn t clear until we had the bill  The staff where great and the location great ,1
 We had to change room 3 times due to problems with the room then being sent to a room that was already occupied We only had 2 days in Paris and where meeting friends for a bday party later that day We spent in hours in the hotel before we had a room that was acceptable standard as agreed by Manager We arrived back a hotel 11 25pm that evening and were told there were no possibly for us to get any food at all No room service the Bar was also closed The staff seemed to find this amusing Very surprising service levels for one of the prominent World Capital Cities  Bed was comfy,0
 Our keycard stopped working several times during our stay reception never answered promptly when called from the room Tried to use room service and the staff redirected my calling abruptly without letting me know what was happening and then room service itself never answered Furthermore why the need to be redirected in the first place when the number gave the impression I would be put straight through to room service The air conditioning in the room was not up to standard it was either too hot or too cold even when we adjusted it An extra bed was provided with the room but no extra blankets or bedding for it Overall very unsatisfactory hotel  The bathroom was nice ,0
 Breakfast I like a location which is close to center and has real Vienna people and real life around Very interersting flea market on Saturdays is located 4 minutes walk ,1

"The rooms seemed a bit mall - it ws fine for two of us but would not work for more than - adults. Our shower-tub had mold around the edge and the security lock was broken. We alerted the front desk in the AM and they were both resolved when we returned. We did enjoy the fridge and microwave. The AC worked great in the Texas heat. The hotel is a great spot if you are going to Fiesta, but not a good stop if you plan on going to the Riverwalk more than once.",0
 the fact that I had advised in advance that we would arrive earlier than check in time and when we arrived at 11 30am we agreed to pay for an upgrade from the standard room to an executive club room extra 35 apparently it is normally 48 but they reduced it to allow us to check in right away i was very disappointed to see that we had paid extra for an extra 2 ft of floor space and a wall mounted television Not at all happy about the service We could have been offered a room to leave our bags until normal check in time but that wasn t suggested  Comfortable bed,0

"Tattered linens, excessive peeling ceiling plaster, large missing tiles in the bathroom. And the air conditioning was not working on a -- degree day. In much need of an upgrade.",0
 Room was very small with small window Location Breakfast,1
 The room was absolutely tiny claustrophobic and oppressive there was one tiny high level skylight and on the event of a fire outside in the corridor this would have made for a very unlikely means of escape reception staff were extremely defensive when asked about the size of the room and if there were any others available and shunned the fact we had used booking dot com to make our reservation  The location was perfect the hotel was smart and clean,0
 I requested a double bed but was given a room with two singles  The breakfast was very good The location is great for the museums ,1
 Did not have one  Hotel was excellent value for what I paid Staff very friendly and helpful Room just lovely and location very good ,1
 internet speed parking cost location park nearby restaurants,1
 More frosting on the shower and toilet walls just a little too revealing A small bar would have been nice but there was a mini bar in the room and plenty of bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel  Apartment provided everything we required and needed The gentleman on reception when we checked in was really friendly and gave us lots of advice and tips to help us make the most of our holiday Staff were always willing and on hand to help with queries and extras we asked for Cleaning staff maids did an excellent job and the apartment was spotless the whole time ,1
 We got scammed London,0
 It could of had a better cafe with light lunches like quick meals and the bar could of had a better selection for dinner Breakfast was great Not far from airport Also not far from city center,0
 Heater was not working the room was freezing We did not get a new room only a little extra noisy heater We were on a separate wing of the building which was smelly due to pipelines I guess Too bad for such a place  Location was great In the middle of Amsterdam center Staff was kind and available ,0
 Shower head wonky No tea coffee facilities in room Breakfast room in basement located in an uninspiring side street  Near Zeiglestrasse U Bahn and shops on Mariahilfe strasse Vienna s Oxford Street Happy staff Nice wine only 2 euros per glass at the bar Balcony doubles as fire escape over looks courtyard Free safe in room,0

 When booking the hotel make it very difficult to book with a company card when I asked to do this I was to provide a whole host of private information and after this was sent they did not fulfill the wish to pay with the card and charged the traveller instead When asked about this there was little acknowledgement of the inconvenience caused and when they finally responded they barely apologised and just signed off with the barest of responses Too expensive a place to stay considering the fallow customer service experience Very disappointed but sadly all to common in such places  The location,0

 Not very close to city center but very close to Praterstern which is a central station  Very friendly personnel Breakfast of high quality Rooms clean and cosy Family friendly ,1
 Breakfast was poor good location next to metro and Freud museum,0
 The place is over priced and should not be a 4 star breakfast was sub par with very minimal selections I would pass in the future on purchasing the breakfast at this hotel There is no temperature controls in the room so the heat is on high all the time this requires keeping the window open even in winter as it is too hot to sleep  location was perfect close to metro and many sites with restaurants and bars within walking distance right around the corner,0

 TV was very quiet even at full volume Staff weren t particularly helpful especially with regards to booking the shuttle bus We were told it had to be booked an hour in advance despite the paperwork saying it was better to book in advance to guarantee your seat We ended up just using the train instead as it was cheaper and far more frequent Prices at the hotel bar are absolutely insane even for Amsterdam  A short distance from the city centre using the number 2 tram or the hotels shuttle bus though the bus is a pain to book Great rooms with nice bathroom and huge comfortable beds kettle fridge and TV including some channels in English Free wifi ,1
 Service could be improved Bit more warmth would be appreciated Friendliness of staff desired Concierge staff should speak good English Location was great Rooms were clean Bed was comfy ,0

 Excellent place to stay for a leisure trip Could also be convenient for a business trip but missing a bar in the lobby they provide coffee though  Excellent location 2mn from the metro and 10mn from plaza de catalunya on foot Lots of restaurants bars around and multiple 24h convenience stores Large clean and comfortable room with a large shower very bright at day time ,1
 The shower in the bathroom overflowed onto the floor when showering poor design  All staff met were exemplary ,1
 The Wi Fi is not free in 21st century Very bad experience surprisingly bad for the Hilton They messed up my reservation they confirmed twice that the breakfast was included The next day while having breakfast they came three times to discuss the confusion that they messed up the night before they gave us again another information which at this point I asked in writing because it was twice that already told me something that it was not true and they redirected me to reception where they gave me a third version I m coming for business to a hotel where I expect that at least staff is professional next time I ll take my business elsewhere  The room was big,0
 0 communication with the hotel we sent many questions through booking and direct e mail but NO ONE answered We asked if we could pay cash when we get there we inquired about the amount of money that was withdrawn Now 8 DAYS LATER the amount they took is still reserved and nobody is answering the staff s attitude gave us a wrong room the view we had a perfect view of a concrete wall see attached photos the breakfast the only edible things were the croissants the tomatoes were old the omelette was not done the thin walls we could hear everything that was going on in the other rooms  The only thing that made our stay worth it was the fact that a subway station was nearby ,0

 Twenty minute tram ride to centre of town and major attractions  Good value hotel Good size room Transportation right in front But nothing close by the hotel other than two small grocery stores and one restaurant ,1
"I have attended a meeting at this hotel in June for the past three years. The only plus is its close proximity to the metro. The minuses are many. Elevators are very slow, my room was very far from the front desk and had a large roach in it. The ice machine on my floor was broken for three days. The cokes in the vending machines are $- for a --oz can. The front desk is understaffed the phone rings -- or -- times and the line can get very long. Twice I have had false room charges for the in room minibar, even when I refused the key to it upon check in. The year before I had a toll call on my bill when I was not even in the room.",0
No Negative Staff couldnt have been more helpful attentive but not intrusive Perfect location for shopping dining very central ,1

 The service was terrible felt as if they were looking down on us because we are a young couple maybe They were seeing to other guests older before us and when we first arrived I had to go down to reception 4 times because they kept making mistakes about our room e g We paid for a double room and they put us in a twin then they forgot to change the key card over to the other room etc Also was on the room phone for 15 minutes and got transferred to another hotels phone They also wanted to take 100 out of our account when we arrived in case we had any meals or snacks when we were there  Nicely decorated bathroom was nice ,0

 I love absolutely everything the only remark I have is that a double bed room is ok for one person but rather small for two beautifully decorated very nice and clean rooms with everything one needs from hair dryer to slippers and enough toiletries The home made cookies box and card are a very nice gesture the reception restaurant area extremely pleasant and cozy ,1
 No car park availability reception staff extremely rude  Comfy bed,0
 Ordered large bed but had 2 singles put together that we kept falling through This was our first trip away in 13 years following my Dads passing on two months ago so very special for us It was so dissapointing Especially as I called ahead 3 times to confirm and paid extra Room was small and paid extra for balcony that was overlooked by flats dogs barked throughout night View was two brick walls Horrible don t pay for balcony there is no point Swimming pool is catorgorised incorrectly It s more of a sitting pool  Hotel decoration modern and pleasant Clean and nice area ,0
 Hotel needs a good cleanup allover and breakfast needs improving though good enough for short stays  Hotel location is excellent Tram stop just outside the door Staff are very friendly and ready to help out Overall stay was wonderful and was the cheapest available hotel during the end of April 2017 ,0
 the room was expensive but due to it s location in London there were several plug sockets in the room but all were too close to a shelf to actually use meaning only 1 plug socket in the room was functional the room was a little dated with damp patches evident for the price i expected more room was comfortable with plenty of space good sized bathroom location was quiet short walk to tube station ,0
 Room was 14 m2 in stead of 20 A fridge with only 1 bottle of water is not a minibar in my eyes Small badroom No Positive,0
 complimentary water in room for whole of stay not just first night stated a free cocktail on card given to us but were told the cocktails were notincluded and could have a beer or cava no bathrobes in bathroom beds and pillows very comfortable breakfast menu great view from room wonderful staff very helpful,1
 I had to leave the hotel at 4 45 in the morning had taken care of all the payments and reserved a taxi a night before Well at 4 30 in the morning the receptionist starting yelling while i was in the taxi pretending why i had not passed thru the reception 4 30 in the morning yelling at a lady Everything taken care before The hotel for the price is nothing special and the services are more of a 3 starhotel than 4  The bed was comfortable,0
 Is far from the city center although you have bus tram and metro stations nearby Ammenities are expensive It s better if you buy bottles of water or sodas out of the hotel The hotel is really nice Food at the restaurant is good too The room was perfect for a solo traveler and for the days I stayed there ,1
 The breakfast was just ok we like boiled eggs there were none with no offer of omelettes or poached eggs Poor continental breakfast as well we had an executive double Wouldn t like to have booked a standard double No Positive,0

No Negative Simply awesome,1
 Room was just shabby  Breakfast was great ,0
 I didn t find my reservation as I did it the reserved apartment with fan not AC I took about 3 hrs to check in even I arrived 10 pm The reception employee was non cooperative and can t solve any problem the case was solved by my suggestion to give me 2 rooms instead of the apartment but one only was with AC and the other with fan so I am totally disappointed and never tell any one about this bad hotel I liked the location only,0
 didn t like the fact I booked and paid for a deluxe double bedroom and got the smallest room that didn t even have a window The bathroom was so small you could barely shut the door if inside and a shower I could just about squeeze into and I m not a big person No Positive,0

 The breakfast was terrible food was luke warm and not replaced Three dried fried eggs sat on the hot plate for the time we were there Far from good  The location,0
 As a 57 year old who travels frequently I have never experienced such dreadful service in any hotel or restaurant Absolutely shocking Mistake after mistake orders not taken then a huge delay before returning to advise half the courses not available Drinks order only partly served Starter course missing Part of main missing and in each case it took an age to get sorted with a waiter who was unfit for the job in every respect apart from appearance Ruined a well planned evening and stay and this is an expensive establishment promising much but failing to deliver  location general decor and atmosphere reception staff Unfortunately all rendered irrelevant as the restaurant and then attitude of the management put this hotel firmly in the never again category,0
 My room was facing onto the back lane and it was very noisy Woken up at 2 45am thinking it was road works but the hotels towels were being collected and the guy moving the crates was making the biggest racket in the middle of the night Then around 6 30am it was the big wheely bins turn to be emptied Not the quietest of rooms Very helpful staff Forgot my toothbrush and they offered me a complimentary one when I was fully expecting a charge Offered an upgrade so got a massive bed The breakfast qas lovely good fresh food ,1
 Payment for spa entry and laundry service Great and friendly staff Wicked facilities especially the rooftop bar Good location not far from the central station ,1
 We were initially placed in a room within an area currently being renovated and the drilling was pretty intrusive No walk in shower at 21 weeks pregnant posed an additional problem and the cleanliness of the first room was not good Had this been the extent of our experience I would have been deeply disappointed  My husband immediately sought assistance and the front desk staff were quick to remedy our unfortunate room placing us on a higher floor away from disturbance The room was sensational spotlessly clean an entirely different feel to it and thank heavens a walk in shower The room change transformed our opinion of the hotel and we were impressed with the nimble and proactive approach from the front of house A lovely night in a super location ensued ,1
 Due to location there is night time street noise The hotel is also expensive  Great central location,1
 Hotel looks on the pciture like five star NO it is weak 4 star but weak nothing special rooms interiors breakfest like in small pension could not recommedn for this price Clean,0

 Low value for money Location,0
 On arriving at the Hotel Reception advised due to Booking com there had been an over booking and that they had organised a room for me at an adjacent Hotel The Hotel was satisfactory but not to the same standard as the pictures of the Norfolk Towers Hotel would indicate Very dissapointed to be messed around like this  Not applicable ,0
 Missed a workout room and had a couple mornings where I had no water but was quickly fixed  The room was nice people great and was very convenient for my work ,1
 The staff were not very friendly at all especially the male staff members They were rather abrupt and very unhelpful It was my first time to London and to be honest My stay here spoilt my whole trip Too many things to list but they really need to focus on their customer service  The room service was really good The handcut chips are to die for They need to do them on the 24 7 menu ,0
 Room quite small mini bar didnt refill until I asked I use room with free mini bar  Location and free wifi,1
No Negative The customer service was impeccable It is a long time since I have received service like this in a British hotel Your staff are wonderful We went out for a run early to be greeted on our return by a doorman proffering a bottle of water and fresh towel ,1

No Negative The rooms are a very high quality and good value for central London The bar atrium is a real unique feature ,1
No Negative Great location 2nd time I ve stayed and they let us check in early,1
"On arrival our first impression was WOW, all the public area's were very grand and the place was full of history. The rooms however were very dreary. A chunky old TV and a battered bathroom but it was clean and tidy and all that we required. We found the concierge really helpful & friendly but the Reception Team were very frosty and some should practice smiling a little more!
Check out there website for deals we paid just $--- a night for the first few nights but then when we had to book and extra night we paid twice that. Loads of hidden costs here as well the Bar was pretty pricey and $-- plus tips to park the hire car per day. Check out the Coffee Shop a few doors down though the guy in there is really helpful if you need any local info.",0
 Rooms are extremely small and cramped  Location ,0
 No drinking water in the room or soap to wash hands Room is quite small Staff were very rude and unwelcoming There was no one to help me with my bags and I was rudely told to take them myself The window view is to the inside of the hotel so depressing as no sunlight gets in the room I certainly believe that 4 stars is a huge over rating for this hotel  Location,0
 bed wasn t overly comfortable and room a bit small for two sharing Staff and location,1
 Wifi not included which is a bit mean nowadays Hotel located great for Kensington and Royal Albert Hall we were attending a show there Room was comfortable and a decent size with a good shower I would stay there again,1
 When you arrive and you pay for your room then they want a deposit of 50 This is unfair because it is not written anywhere when you book your room Air conditioning doesn t work properly stinky air comes out when you turn it on  Location ,0
No Negative Look this hotel best one I ve stayed in for ages,1
 Billing issues Billed for breakfast when I didn t have it Billed room at 75 more than booking com when confronted said software issues Aircon not ok too hot Gave room suitable for 4 but when I asked for a single room but better view they wanted to charge me for it Close to river but away from activity and city centre metro is 10 minutes walk Staff at bar seems to too busy and hence courtesy not the 1st thing you will get View from hotel Front desk help,0
 Staff was horrible and not helpful No Positive,0

No Negative Lovely hotel Interior is spot on Staff were really efficient and helpful We checked in early without any extra fee Bar prices reasonable and roof top swimming pool absolutely wonderful Going to Lisbon next year and will be booking into the H10 there hoping it s as good ,1
"We waited three and a half hours to get a room and we were not the only people waiting. We asked multiple times about how much longer we would have to wait to be told they didn't
know how long it would take. The hotel was not up to the usual standards of cleanliness. Checkout time is noon, they called our room at --.--am to ask us to vacate. The staff were rude and the manager even ruder would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",0
"If you're looking for a central location, to explore SF then this is a great budget option.
Rooms are tiny, but the space is well organised and all amenities are available.
Immaculately clean, comfortable beds and yes there is a reasonable amount of street noise, but you're in a very busy city in a very tourist populous area, so its not fair to complain about that. Very friendly and helpful staff. Would stay there again if I was in SF. 
Tip: If you have heavy luggage (like me) there is a street level elevator on the corner of Ellis & Market streets to access Powell St station, much easier than trying to negotiate stairs. i reccomend using the BART train from SFO to downtown its cheap, efficent, safe and very clean.",1
"- staffs attitude was not very good. did not smile. not very service-friendly
- No coffee for breakfast, coffeemaker was all day defect
- Very sound can clearly hear the people living upstairs
- towels were worn and with long dark hair!
- beggars outside the hotel",0
 The temperature of the shower was really hard to set Top level hotel ,1
 The rooms are a little on the small side and very basic Furnished in a similar style and standard to a budget motel The biggest negative is that the rooms do not have air conditioning you have to rely upon a cooling fan that can be found in the bottom of the wardrobe If arriving by car you have to plan your arrival with military precision as there are no parking facilities and no drop off point at the front of the hotel  The doormen and bell boys were particularly friendly and very helpful In general the staff were very polite and nothing too much trouble The hotel was very clean the breakfast selection good The common areas of the hotel are very pleasant ,0
 Probably the smallest hotel room I have stayed in around the world with the bed taking up nearly the whole area There was mud on the valance around the bed The A C failed and the room was so stuffy and hot that I had to open the window on to noisy Gower St all night I was given a fan by reception which helped a bit  The breakfast and the shower toilet were fine ,0
 being old maintenance  location breakfast ,0
 Only outlet stadium near hotel would have been better if there was more but this is not the hotels fault  Staff was so friendly and the cleanliness of the hotel you just could not fault ,1
 The wedding reception ball room played music way beyond midnight and kept us awake The regulatory fire drill woke us up at 1 30am on our last night of stay and then we were made to hang out in our PJs on a cold very early morning in London The bathtub flooded while having a shower and did not drain properly The air conditioning in the room did not work and was very hot There was a bad smell in the corridor on the way to our room every day  Close to shops,0
No Negative The location was excellent Its location on Shaftesbury Avenue was so convenient and meant that it was only a short walk to all the theatres and restaurants Covent Garden and China Town were both very close Above all this was the friendliness and courtesy of the staff They were excellent ,1

 The only thing I don t like was the small size of the room but I understand that in London this is very common to have small rooms in hotels  The bed was comfy although was small The staff were friendly and accommodating The room was made clean everyday Location was very close to Paddington station which has easy access to Heathrow airport and other train stations ,1
 Cold shower dirty cloth left in the shower and the cleaner woke us up at 7 45am No Positive,0

 I liked everything good value for money  The king bed room was very comfortable despite being on the lower ground floor and not very large It was immaculate very well designed and clean Everything worked perfectly the bed was very comfortable shower excellent and even a little desk with enough power outlets at desk level to make connecting multiple devices very straightforward I highly recommend the hotel and I will be back,1
 nothing  the food was incredible the service the same can t fault it ,1

"I was a conference attendee at this hotel, located a short ride from IAH. As a Diamond Honors member, I was not upgraded to the exec level, but had access. The room is nice sized, large flat panel tv, desk area, small amount of ac plugs. Wifi was comp'd as diamond and signal was good. The bath was good sized, too. Each night there was turndown service and the ice bucket was filled, but no bottled water (made little sense). Housekeeping mediocre. I was disappointed this year (vs. last) in the exec lounge. Morning offerings were slim, nothing hot except for coffee. Evening offerings were also slim, as well. Guessing maybe cost reductions because other full-service Hiltons are better. All in all, I would rate average to slightly better.",0

 We came to have breakfast last minute which was completely out fault however arranged with the reception that it was still ok But then were interrogated by every personnel in the restaurant if we were still allowed to take food  The staff was excellent very friendly Overall the hotel was very good but left a feeling that was either still under constructions or renovation Was missing a final touch for a truly five star hotel,1

 The only problem I had which was probably down to me Was that the room was very hot and I couldn t work out how to turn the temperature down  Staff were friendly and welcoming The hotel looks very grand and classy but I felt very comfortable with my 6yo daughter The room was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom The buffet breakfast was well stocked fresh and tasty ,1

"This was my second time staying at the Taj Boston this year and I am less impressed each time. The rooms are just not up to the standard of a luxury hotel. The bathroom was so small that my boyfriend and I had to take turns using the mirror-counter space to get ready for dinner. 
We did have a drink at the bar and the service was spot on; however, I think that it is time to seek out other hotels in the area until they do some updating.",0

 We had a really nice room on the 3rd floor the first time we stayed here Based on that we booked later for another 2 nights and found ourselves in a dark and musty half underground room Equipped like our first room but overall a lot worse and told they had no other rooms It would have been ok for half the price but definitely not for what we were paying No Positive,0

 Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves  Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom ,1

 The room was ok Had to prompt reception staff at 3pm to clean my room on the 2nd day of my stay The breakfast was very substandard I ve had better in a Travel Lodge terrible coffee and had to wait a while for my eggs Overall not what I was expecting for the cost of my stay  Central location,0

No Negative Room was perfect for my stay bed extremely comfortable Perfect location for the theatres and tube Staff were fantastic really interested in what you were doing each day and went the extra mile to help find attractions you were after Stayed twice in 3 months now and love this Hotel I ll definitely be back,1
 Surprisingly enough the breakfast wasn t so great I was hoping for a fine Italian coffee and it was anything but There was little alternative if you didn t want pastries for breakfast everything was decent but not wow Another irk was the size of the steam sauna After walking about 10 km every day we were hoping to relax for a 15 minute steam and sauna but the sauna didn t work and the steam room was tiny mind you when we tried to enter two people were lying down inside taking up the whole space and didn t even attempt to move over  Close to everything you need in Milan Clean room nice staff ,1

 Location a little too far from transport links Excellent breakfast and staff very helpful ,1
"I normally avoid airport hotels but this one was well reviewed on this site, so I gave it a go. The location is perfect for quick airport getaways with a direct check in gate for those with hand luggage only and an internal entrance to the main hall if you need to check in luggage. When arriving at the airport you need to use the well signposted courtesy bus and it's a suprisingly long journey around the airport site!
The bar, resturant, atrium, pool and gym are all excellent and as described by the other reviews. My only compaint was thelaundry service. Given that this is an airport hotel you would expect something quick, instead they send it off to the other side of Detroit on a -- hour service, this despite me telling them that I needed it in the morning and writing this on the instructions!",0
 Needed USB connections in room Comfortable beds ,1
 We booked a Junior Suite for quite an expensive rate and got a small dark room 1sr floor looking to the trash in the back yard We then complaint and got the same room in the sixt floor I just booked this hotel due to the great reports on booking com but having been there people must have been crazy or stayed another hotel I would not go there again there are many more hotels in Paris with a better offer  Nothing ,0

 The spare bed was too short for an adult and we were unfortunate to have building works right outside our window the hotel should have given us the option of changing rooms when they must have known it was going to impact on our sleep as well as dust from the giant skips going up into the air we had to keep the windows closed all day There were one or two reception staff that were helpful and others that seemed totally disinterested in us as tourists or whether we were happy with our room or their service  Excellent Location very elegant hotel with lovely decor furnishings,1

We stayed here for - nights and it was at the end of our road trip down the Californian coast. I had really high expectations of this hotel but they didn't really live up to them. Our room was in a block opposite the reception on the -rd floor and was dated and felt dirty. On the Friday night there was a wedding and the function room must have been above us as all we could hear was loud music late into the night. The grounds were pretty and the pool area was nice but the private beach was not that nice and I didn't feel like I wanted to swim there so stuck to the pool instead. I would not stay here again and for me I wish I had stayed in the down town area of San Diego.,0
No Negative What a great hotel Loved the Saturday night vibe in the bar ,1
 I had specifically requested to pay in advance via bank transfer for my clients who were staying Even though I had proof of payment from the bank they still would not accept this and charged my clients again at check in offering a refund when they received my transfer This caused me great embarrassment and when I called to deal with the problem all I asked for was a phone call to update me the following day so this did not happen on the second night But I did not receive a call and again my guests were refused check in for the second time as supposedly the money had not be transferred I only spoke with one staff member who was remotely helpful and unfortunately I do no know his name No Positive,0

 Family room we had could do with being refurbished Room hot but air conditioning not working Ceiling tiles broken shower good but no thermostatic control so took a while to get temperature right Exterior looked dirty and some rendering cracks Lovely feature was room had a balcony but no furniture outside perhaps this is because of the time of year  Being close to train station metro and hop on hop off bus mede this hotel the perfect location ,0
 Can t think of any negatives I loved it  Although slightly outside of the centre it was in an easy to access area with a tram stop right outside the hotel taking you to central station in 10 15 minutes Because it s not right in the centre it is excellent value when you consider the price against the quality cleanliness and the large sized rooms I would definitely stay here again next time ,1

 Poor service our TV was not working and despite repeated complaints it took them 3 days to send someone from maintenance and then he showed up at 10 30 pm and woke us up Waited 45 minutes in the hotel restaurant just to get a menu and it was empty  The location is wonderful steps from the underground and Mayfair shopping district ,0
"Just a note to congratulate two Intercontinental Harbor Court Hotel employees who made our stay a most memorable one.
Mr. Josean Rosado, executive chef, who prepared a wonderful lunch for my wife and I. Mr. Rosado prepared a - course lunch that will always be remembered.
I would also like to mention Zoe at the Expresso Bar who made every visit a special one.

"The Hotel San Jose is a refreshing oasis in the heart of the weirdness that is Austin. It is located in the trendy area called SoCo or South Congress. The are is bustling with great shops, bars, and restaurants that are all within walking distance. There are also several great attractions within walking distance; congress avenue bats, the Lady Bird lake and trails, and a scenic neighborhood. ,y favorite coffee shop, Jo's, is also in the parking lot.

"I stayed here last winter (late January ----) on business, in one of the top floor rooms with a full-on view of the white house. I have to say, the view was stunning and the room was very pretty. However, something was wrong with the heating in my room, and it was about -- degrees. It was really unbearable. They sent up an engineer to fix it, but it made no difference. I ended up having to sleep with the window open in the dead of winter -- not a very relaxing way to end a long day of meetings.",0
 After specifically asking reception to make the payment due on the authorization they have authorized the amount again days after my stay there Unacceptable I couldn t have been more clear Their staff needs more training when it comes to payment Much more No Positive,0
"We were privledged to stay at the Inn at Cherry Creek during a recent trip to CO. for our daughter's graduation from The Univ. of Denver. The Inn is located within walking distance to many wonderful boutiques, restaurants, and the Cherry Creek Mall. Our suite was exceptional in every way - clean, spacious, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. The staff was incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. The restaurant offered a variety of culinary delights, beautifully presented, and had a nice wine list, as well. Here again, the wait staff was top-notch. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience of this Inn, and highly recommend it.",1
 Room was small and the small window did not make the room very light  Staff were friendly and professional Very clean Lovely breakfast which was well worth the money ,1
Stayed at Barton Creek in December ----. I agree with the previous reviews that the resort needs updating. This was going on during our stay and it will be completed by May ---- so I would wait until then to stay there. On a more positive note the Golf courses were great and the greens were fantastic. A friend of mine who lives in the area say's that April thru June is the time to enjoy the Austin area.,0
"Location tips the scales to make this an excellent choice, but the price (few free amenities) and quality of the shower tip it back to a very good rating. We would stay here again. We spent two nights strolling Independence Park and the surrounding areas at night, having them virtually to ourselves. It was much quieter than expected given the location, but we were disappointed to be able to hear neighboring guests who weren't all that loud. The staff works hard to please. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, with very comfortable bedding. If you want bustling night life, you might try closer to City Hall, but if you're interested in Philadelphia's history, this is a great place to stay.",1
No Negative This hotel was by far one of the nicest I have ever stayed in I just have one quiery we had to pay a 30 euros supplement a day for extra person but I booked for four people two rooms so not sure why had to pay extra can you please answer as 180 euros more than budgeted for ,1

The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was a great size as well. It is very convenient to the Easton Town Center and they run a shuttle. Breakfast was OK, not the best I ever had, but for basic sustenance it did the trick. The eggs were the only think that left some to be desired. That is me being critical, it is truly a smart choice for hotels in the Easton area. Would recommend to anyone in the area.",1

"If you are working near the Hill or visiting the Smithsonian this is the perfect location. The staff was delightfully helpful and friendly. The bed was comfortable and the room was large enough. The hotel was clean. Bathroom counter space was limited, which required a balancing act for the hair drier, makeup application, etc. The pedistal sink looks nice but isn't practical. There are no safes in the rooms! This unpleasant inconvenience forced me to go three times per day to the safe deposit box downstairs. Sometimes there was a line. The rooms are being renovated in the next few months, as I was told it has been ten years. There is hope for a room safe in the future.",1
 Breakfast had limited selection bland taste and bad coffee Very friendly staff Free WiFi,1

Parked car in hotel parking lot and took advantage of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stay and park"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at the hotel. Paid something like $-- to park for the week. Hotel was under construction which we didn't know about. We booked online via Expedia and no where was it posted that this place was under construction. Temp front desk was in a small banquet room as was their breakfast service in the morning. Check-in took way too long. Carpet in the hallways was filthy and very outdated. Oh.....and when we got back from our trip, heard from shuttle driver that numerous vehicles were broken into while we gone. One car in the parking lot was sitting on cinder blocks with all four tires gone. Stay anywhere else on Tower Rd but this hotel.",0

 Room very small nothing like expectations from the picture about 18 either side of the bed but one side was under the eves so you had to duck and shuffle along to get in the bed Bed was like a plank of wood extremely firm Room was noisy as it was right opposite the lift so could hear it clanking and groaning all night may have been more obvious because of not being able to sleep because of the bed Rooms very hot in the day and very cold overnight heating seemed to go off around 11pm and come back on full force about 5am Did not have breakfast because even with the discount offered on arrival it was still very overpriced  Staff were helpful place was very clean throughout Reasonable choice of TV channels Good location about a 10 15 minute walk to Dam Square ,0

 Most of it The room was old probably decorated in the 1980 s the corridor was dark and the carpets were old and had a must smell The bath was too short to use and the towel rail was at head height about 1 ft away when taking a shower The hot breakfast was poor with hard bacon and waffles being kept in warmers too long the staff in the restaurant were not friendly or efficient when I complained about my room I was told there was a more modern one available but the bed had separate mattresses Very poor value for money I wrote a complaint to the hotel and the response was to justify rather than correct The location The bar area,0

I travel a lot and tend to rate my hotels by the staff first, and this staff was overwhelmingly accomodating. They are there to help as much as possible. Would be nice to have internet included, but their business center was excellent and most accomodating.

"As part of a volleyball team we booked thought the housing system set up as a result of the tournament. 
Since I dont frequent Marriot properties, I was curious about the rewards program so I inquired at check-in and unfortunately the Front Desk agent didnt have the knowledge that I expected.
We were not given a late checkout, I somewhat understand this. I know how it works, when the hotel is sold out it is tough to say yes to a late checkout when your occupancy is high the next day. However we rented --+ rooms and I asked if we could use - room for everyone until -:--. Only -.- hours after c-o. This wasnt a lot to ask and for a club that has stayed here before, and will be returning this request was not difficutlt to grant.",0

 The view from our room could have been a little better as we were placed in a room whose view was directly at another building so we couldn t see the city from our room But I m sure most of their rooms have better views  I appreciated how close the hotel was to the main part of Barcelona but you couldn t hear all of the outside rush The rooms were also sound proof which was great for our midday naps ,1
 The breakfast room was a little crowded  The bed was comfy the shower was lovely and hot ,1
 Small room tea maker in the room fantastic view of Eiffel tower,1
 Having to pay 10 parking 25 on event days I would expect actual parking spaces not try squeeze your car into a tight gap next to a wall or another car I had asked for a bath as I have really bad sciatica and wanted to be able to relax Also had asked for a balcony as the room I was given didn t even have a window I could open The light on the wall was broken dirty mirrors The bed wasn t clean the bathroom wasn t clean I ve stayed here previously before booked 20mins after 10pm before I arrived had asked for a bath balcony which I was given Was disappointed was planning to come back not sure I will again No Positive,0

"Where to start...we are Starwood members and prefer to stay at Westin hotels because they meet our expectations. The Book Cadillac failed miserably. There was no door person to open the door, no bell person to take our luggage, there were Starbucks coffee sleeves in the foyer of our suite, we had no ironing board, there as no remote control for the television, and the requested hypoallergenic bedding failed to materialize. We have never had a single complaint about a Starwoods property, but this was by far the worst hotel experience we have had in years.",0
 Small bed Inexpensive breakfast Free Wi Fi Located close to the city centre Very effective blinds to prevent daylight from waking me up early,1

No Negative Great location in modern shopping complex outside city center but excellent transport from and to city center 6 minutes train ride from St Pancras station This hotel has much better value for money than hotels in the city center Breakfast is excellent as well This has become my goto hotel for every visit to London No more bad hotel experiences in London for me ,1
"A telling sign of a business not-so-well ran: this motel is still missing a sign, after it has been broken by hurricane Ike four months ago. The place is hard to see at night even though it is right next to the highway.
The receptionist was very nice even though we arrived very late, the motel has a nice lobby, we got a spacious room with a working TV and remote. 
However, the room had a smell to it, and the ancient A-C unit was very noisy. The bathroom was less than clean, and the water not quite hot. The advertised wi-fi was not working. 
Overall, pretty sad place.",0
 They didn t change bead sheets daily The bead was not comfortable at all No Positive,0
 The original attitude to my complaints was harsh I was shown a room different room that was worse than the first and then shown a room that I was told I could have if I paid more It was only until our last night that things were put right due to the kindness and understanding of the House Manager  The first three days were a disappointment as our room was nothing like the photo on the web I did complain however arrangements to move us to a proper room were only for our last night The house manager made every effort to make it special and because of him I would stay there again however only if I could make a specific room request ,0
 When I triad the wi Fi I found I must pay 4 5 Euro for one day normal speed and 12 5 Euro for high speed I complaint to reception Her reply was shocking As punishment not using direct booking through Marriot hotel they charge them Wi Fi But if you are passing by in the lobby may using the toilets you can get the WiFi free Which is astonishing No Positive,0

 Parking very difficult Was told there was parking at Marriott but only 10 places All taken Nearest NCP car park 10 minutes fast walk away and small and smelly Fresh food and good coffee at breakfast,1
 Corridors a bit too dark and there was no one else in the restaurant around 10pm We would have been happy with a light meal in the bar but I don t think that was an option  Beds are unbelievably comfortable ,1
"I recently stayed at this Hotel for business and the location was convenient and the rooms were pretty standard. They seemed to be understaffed when we checked in as there was only were person working at the desk to answer calls and check people in.The positives were that the free wifi and the fact that we were able to walk to our meetings 
The major negative was that I left my Kindle in the room and when I returned to the hotel that afternoon it was gone. Housekeeping had no trace of it and now I have to buy a new device. Amazon said that someone called to re register it but they were unable to. This was a disturbing experience would turn me off from returning to this hotel especially since there are so many option in Chicago.",0

 When I booked they gave me a room which you could hardly rate it 2 star Smell of tobacco had remained in curtains and carpet They gave me worse room just because I had not book directly through hotel When I asked to change the room they did but again very uncomfirtsble bed and noisy was close to lift and neighbors were slamming the door all the time I did not sleep at all I am not a rich man from gulf countries who carries lots of 50 notes with me i work so hard to get a treat like that The reason I booked the hotel was to have a good rest as I had a appointment in the nearby hospital the mini bar was left emty so no water at night to drink  Location wise was good,0

 Bad management of the front desk  Location ,0
No Negative Good all round business tourist hotel within walking distance of Euston and St Pancras ,1
 As the hotel was on one of the main roads it was quite noisy at times at night time when sleeping think this was because we were at the front of the hotel  Hotel cleanliness was excellent housekeeping did a great job great breakfast lots of choice prices in the bar for food and drinks were really reasonable staff were very friendly and helpful lovely views from the roof top pool nice spa gym Good location,1
 Usual slow check in process It was quiet,1
 Breakfast was dreadful Felt an inconvenience to most of the staff too Wouldn t go back  Lovely interiors ,0
 In the room there are some things that I didn t like bathroom some problems with water and basin windows works automatically that makes you feel uncomfortable Especially we didn t like the system of payment because the hotel took money from our account and still it didn t release unless we came back home  Location some of the staff was polite breakfast not bad,0

"I stayed for two nights while on business in the area. This hotel is conveniently located on Mira Mesa Blvd, close to Hwy ---. 
PROS: friendly staff, clean and spacious room with a small kitchen, good (free) hot breakfast, pretty back patio area, close to restaurants (strip mall next door with varied choices-Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese, Fresh & Easy market, etc..)
CONS: None really. It was slightly hard to find because the hotel is tucked behind a Shell gas station and the Staybridge sign is not very prominent.",1
 My room was in a poor state and seemed as though it was just drying out after a bathroom flood The room also had a strong musty odour On the evening of my stay I was unable to order food from the restaurant as I was advised the wait would be at least 2 hours After reporting the problems with my room at thge front desk and being told someone would be up to speak to me no one came up to see me No Positive,0
"Our first disappointment was no Free WIFI, we could purchase it for $-.-- a day but really every other place we stay offers FREE Wifi, why does Doubletree charge?? Second disappointment, no breakfast of any kind included...oh yes, there was - cup of coffee each in the room!!! Guess I should have done more research, and you can bet we will NOT stay there again. Oh yes almost forgot, the newspaper that was delivered to our door each morning was also charged for!!!",0
 The hair dryer is one of the old fashioned on the wall hose type contraptions from the 1970 s May be ok for men but utterly hopeless for a woman getting ready to go to a business meeting unimpressed in 2017 Does the hotel cater only to men coming to the football Don t woman accompany them  Bed was comfy,1
 It was difficult to get a drink or food from the bar during the day as the bar lady kept disappearing and the food menus where not on all the tables so we ordered nibbles instead and then found the food menu on an adjoining table However we did then order a proper lunch Home made pizza and chips which was excellent and good value for money too  We liked the size and cleanliness of the queen size room for only 104 including breakfast on a Saturday night stay ,1

No Negative The receptionist is really bad and aggressive,0
 Not good as the DoubleTree I stayed in Guangzhou China I called several times to check the location but nobody picked up the phone No smile on the reception lady No sorry and only said she was too busy when I complained nobody picked up my phone Lot of foreigners were celebrating at the lobby bar very noisy The room is a little smelly but no way to be ventilated only to turn on the A C Most facilities in the rooms are cheap like fastfood especially the shower curtain which even could not be fully closed  The price on that night at is good The breakfast is good It is close to Imperial Wharf station of a overground line ,0
 When room service changed the blanket the replaced it with dirty blanket which was a shock  The location,0
 Rooms are very small also the pressure in the shower is not good Eat in the restaurant this time last year when I travelled with my wife and it was excellent and was hoping that it would have kicked on but this time I felt the food while good had stepped backwards Staff ,0
 Could have included hot breakfast within the price  Stayed here with a friend for a few days and was great The rooms were clean and the bed was comfy And only a five minute walk from Queensway tube station ,1
 Television did not really work got stuck at certain channels and it just hung did not bother to ask someone to fix it Nothing much happening immediately near the hotel especially restaurants and grocery shops Could use a cheap uber ride though 16mins walk to Shoreditch area according to Google map One of the two bathrobes had a bad scent as if it was not cleaned  Very new hotel so it was clean and good facilities Comfy bed and nice bed linens 2mins walk to Old Street station Good value for money London standard hard to find as good alternatives at the same price range,1
 no refrigerator pure wifi Exellent location,0
No Negative Perfect location relaxed atmosphere very friendly staff,1
 The room not clean noisy all the time The hotel old and not value the money it is very strange to be 4 star hotel,0
This hotel is average. The staff was friendly. Only problem was I had to call a few times to get towels and the double bed was small(and I am very petite). The price was inline with the hotel-average. Rooms didn't have a refridge or microwave. This would be a great economical place to stay with friends,0
 NOTHING EVERYTHING,1
 Beds hard run down more like a 2 star disappointing Stayed here a few years ago and it was ok the recent stay was not worth the money very disappointed ,0
 We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off  Free bottle of water and coffee and tea Location and reception,0
 Ordered a burger from the Bertie s Bar but it was one of the worst burgers I have had The actually meat was hard and tasted like de frozen cheap burgers you get from supermarket I expected a bit higher standard from such a hotel No Positive,0

 Room very small Bathroom also very small with cramped shower and doors that didn t shut  Comfortable bed Friendly staff ,0
 enormous high parking fee  good hotel nice staff rich breakfast perfect cleanliness ,1
 Poor cleaning of room bin not emptied and poor cleaning of bathroom Charge of 100 00 deposit like a previous customer said makes you feel like a thief and for what water that in a supermarket costs 90p and in the hotel 2 50 A snickers bar costing 3 00 why an earth would we have them at such extortionist prices the hotel need to get real The view from the window looking at the DRL underground trains go by  The bed very big and comfortable Staff on the reception area were very helpful Lovely breakfast ,0

 London has many places offering better value for money Bed shower at the Nadler are ok but for the rest room no 112 was nothing special little daylight no view bit crammed no art no pleasant surprises Hotel is very close to underground 5 min walk but the area itself is quite dull and offers hardly any well rated restaurants and or bars  Friendly reception decent bed and shower ,0
 No Air conditioner after Oct15th Staff,0
No Negative Everything was just perfect ,1
 The pillows are absolutely horrific In order to get to our room we had to walk through a garden which was fine unless it was raining then it was annoying We paid for a room with a balcony and it turned out said balcony was actually a fire escape  Breakfast was amazing Hotel was excellent value for money and the location was perfect Will definitely be staying here again ,1
 My room wasn t great 1st floor at the front of the building near the goods lift But I did before book last minute 11pm on the night of my stay and it was Milan fashion week  The staff were friendly and the breakfast was good ,0
 There was nothing to complain about The only thing that could maybe be improved was the docking station didn t have a connecter for our iPhone 5 s so we couldn t play music whilst getting ready but it wasn t exactly an issue  We had such an amazing night and the hotel was stunning Definitely want to come back Everything from booking to checking out was so simple and hassle free and for the price we paid the experience we had was unreal ,1
 Very outdated no bar and a very small seating area in reception My room 603 looked straight into the windows of around five other rooms Much better hotels in London for that sort of money  Not much,0
 Cleanliness was not as good as it could be On entering the room the toilet had not been cleaned thoroughly so not a good first impression Good size room studio however very fiddly light switches with too many options made it difficult to use the various lighting options Give me a basic on off switch Twin beds in the room had a camp bed feel and were not very comfortable with plastic under sheets which didn t make for the best night s sleep Overall layout of the hotel is a bit disorganised with reception and check in on the first floor which is ridiculous when you have a lot of luggage and small children Overall style over function Would not stay here again  Good location and little traffic noise ,0
 NoNo Positive,1
 If you are a light sleeper get a room away from the street The trams run late into the night and are noisy Coming from Milan Malpensa airport by train the connecting metro station is Duomo which is quite a long walk from the hotel with luggage There is a closer metro station but it s on another line  The room facilities were very good and I wished that we could have stayed here on our second visit to Milan during the trip The breakfast buffet was also very good ,1
"Good service, nice host,perfect location.",1
"I had sought out a budget-friendly hotel in San Diego that did not cost an arm and a leg. I had heard that this budget hotel is very Marine-friendly, and they are! They offer a free shuttle to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot as well as a free airport shuttle. A basic continental breakfast is included. The rooms are very clean and the management is wonderful. The desk clerk actually sought out my son (Marine graduate) in the lobby and congratulated him and thanked him for serving our country! This is not a luxury hotel by any means, it is a fairly basic motel, but I found it very convenient. People have commented that the neighborhood is not good....it is one of those areas that few would confuse with Beverly Hills, but it seemed safe enough.",0
No Negative Service from all staff was exceptional ,1
 Breakfast was not good ran out of things very quickly even at 8 a m too small a room for amount of guests  Roof top bar excellent,1
 Breakfast far too expensive for what we had and the staff were not at all helpful Probably the worst hotel I ve stayed in for breakfast service and cost Ordered a coffe and a chocolate from the bar arrived in small cups and cost nearly 8 plus service charge Stayed in room 224 226 the noise from the street kept us up most of the night Couldn t fault the location for the theatre nor the cleanliness but far too expensive No Positive,0

 The restauent was very poor on service No this no that Everything you adk theres none No Positive,1
 Only slight problem was the noise from the stairs when people departed There was a steady stream from about 4am  Good Value for money I was in their second site across the road which was fine Bedroom was nicely decorated and bathroom clean and all functioning ,1
"Great location (--th & -th), really close to everything. Hotel still undergoing renovation but renovated rooms are cool. Small, but decent for NYC. Looked clean on first glance but then we found a sock which didn't belong to us, so we became a bit suspicious...! Also, things are just shabby around the edges - no accessible powerpoints, even when you find them half don't work. 
It's a decent hotel and great for a short stay, especially for the price, but just don't expect the earth. We found the concierge useless, and we found the luggage porters were not shy of asking for tips which we found a little forward. But otherwise, staff were very nice, it's convenient, and you'll have a good stay there.",0
 Horrible view Too warm  Helpfulness of staff ,0
 VERY BAD INTERNET CONNECTION It was just impossible to do any online work Extremely slow connection with several limitations If you need to stay yourself online this is not the right place to be Very good location for tourists,0
 Tiny bathroom The smallest type of double bed The least luxurious carpet Only enough milk to have one drink each The lift was very slow  They did change our room when we requested a room that had a window with natural light a view rather than opening onto a ventilation shaft ,0

 Room extremely small remote control and other facilities in room missing Easy access to Victoria station Buckingham Palace,0
 Pillows are poor and they had a leak in the lobby all my stay as if unable to fix  Great location for seeing London,0
 The hotel completely ignored our special request for a twin room despite the fact that we had requested that they let us know if they couldn t provide it We had to wait several hours on arrival for a room that matched our requirements No apologies Just said they had no record of the request which still shows on the Booking com website Plumbing very old fashioned and tiles severely cracked in bathroom  The bedroom was a reasonable size and had good facilities ,0

No Negative All the staff were very friendly and helpful and some went above and beyond that ,1
 the staff requires more of customer satisfaction knowledge and training rooms are small epically for twin rooms rooms furniture is old  the location is great,0
 Nothing Very pleasant surroundings,1
The security there and cops show up and are allowed to just walk into your room without your permission. If you plan on drinking they will come in and write tickets. Just a for-warning for anyone wanting to do that. You sign a waiver saying you are under -- when checking in and thats why they come check your rooms.,0
No Negative Everything about the hotel was spot on The staff were friendly and helpful We booked last minute after our first hotel was such poor condition and we were put into a room straight Way before the normal check in time,1

 Too old Beds not confortable bathroom very old Room too small Only Location,0
"We stayed at the Harborside Inn for a long weekend in June. It is located a short walk from the harbor and Quincy Market. The building is a restored warehouse. The rooms are very spacious especially for a big city hotel in the medium price range. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There isn't a restuarant on site, but many choices in walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come back next year.",1
"Stayed one night for next day early flight. friendly staff, nice shuttle service, convenient location
Room was clean and quiet, bed quailty was great. I didn't hear much noise from the planes.
i will definite stay here again!!",1
"The good: Walking distance to shoppng and major tourist areas. Area is full of revolutionary history sites. History takes place at this hotel. It seemed safe to walk to places within a -- block radius of the hotel.
The bad: Service is spotty from the doorman to the restaurants and lounges to the room accomodations. Although the decor in the restaurants is charming the food and service within them are at best just OK. We had numerous rooms rented and the most prevalant comment by the occupants was the room's lack of size including small bathrooms.",0
 Pillows Very polite staff lovely room and particularly clean,1
"Clsoe to Old Town Trolley and public transportation, location is great, but service is not that good.
If you are trying to reach general manager for any reason (who will of course add a copied letter saying how he wants to hear from you and how open he is for comments), just forget it because he will NEVER get back to you, which - I think - from a general manager of a hotel is RUDE.
Also, one girl in the front desk is completely lost in this world, as long as you only check in and out, she is ok, but she can't handle any additional requests or questions...you will easily recognise her because she is sloooow! 
Location is ok, make sure you get a courtyard view room because otherwise it might get noisy from the highway.",0
 The hotel is very outdated it really could do with being modernized The pool area however is modern lovely  Very easy to walk to the beach the beach clubs in the evening,0
"This was definitely the best hotel I've stayed at. The location, views and service was wonderful. I only stayed three days, but did not want to leave. It was worth the money,",1
No Negative The location is very central and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly,1

This hotel was in an excellent location close to Central Park. The room was small but room enough for -. The bedding was comfortable. Nice complimentary breakfast in small dining area. Room was clean.,1
 Noisy room at the front of the hotel I know this is central London but the traffic noise did not really die down at all Sirens were going off until 1am and I now understand that the hotel is close to a hospital If you stay here ask for a quiet room at the back of the hotel Hair dryer very basic on bathroom wall Shower leaked all over the bathroom floor as the glass shower panel was not wide enough  Room service club sandwich and continental breakfast was very good although pricey ,0
 Nothing  Nice location Very quiet Breakfast is good ,1

 Extra larger pillows would be good Great breakfast extremely friendly staff,1

No Negative Awesome hotel nice luxury feel and close enough to London but without the rip off price ,1
 Very hit and miss on the rooms We were first allocated a box room I could nearly touch both sides of the room We asked to move however there were no other rooms available They did move us on the second night to a much larger room however my frustration was the lack customer service on the front desk If you get a large room the value for money is great however the smaller rooms are tiny and so you could be left disappointed with the lack of space  Great location very close to Paddington station The breakfast was also good and hotel was clean and modern ,0
 The water wasn t working the hallways were dirty not one convenient feature of room  The lobby These rest of the building could have been in a 60s movie ,0
 Rooms a little small and had to climb stairs to room no lift  Beds comfy and position so vonvenient,1
 No Tea Coffee making falcility in the room outside of meal time only a very poor coffee available from a vending machine Beds were very old and mattresses gave little or no support On all three nights we reported loud noises from the a joining room with no effort by staff to address this mater so three very poor nights sleep  Close to local Metro line so easy to get into and out of the city,0
No Negative Service very friendly and helpful by french standards Location super and rooms very quiet and comfortable Breakfast again good by Paris hotel standards Air conditioning was essential in 38 degree heat Good Sushi next door,1
 Space Too small even for one person Difficult to move around Quality of furnishings and excellence of staff Gabriel and Lisa at Reception were outstanding examples of what hospitality can mean Further they were resourceful in helping me with difficulties that impacted my activities while in London and certainly went a long way in compensating for the too small size of the room ,0
No Negative We were upgraded to a superior room,1
 Breakfast not included in the room cost which made the room cost seem rather expensive  The location as we was catching an AM train the following morning from Victoria Station The complementary bottle of Bubbly to celebrate our anniversary was a nice surprise and thank you for that ,0

 The third bed was small our shower had some problems and they fixed after one day Location staff pillows Small and cozy hotel,0
Great apartments next to each other. Self selected door codes made access to the two apartments easy with many guests. Convenient 7/11 downstairs. The staff was even better as they greatly assisted us with a personal issue,1

No Negative great location reasonable price,1
 There was no lift the staff didn t know the area they would call me back with info and they didn T Shame the healthy restaurant in the hotel only served breakfast from 9am  The location was good for me ,0
 When I came back to the hotel almost 4 30pm my room wasn t made up I found this a bit annoying as I had been out and about since 8 00am and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready While at the lounge I waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink Eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly However when it came to paying for the drink I found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink The chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings  room was very well appointed clean and comfortable Breakfast was good ,1
 Small room Wasn t clean Tiny bathroom Dated Location,0
No Negative Excellent service loved the little balcony ,1
 I don t have any complaints  The room was very much to my taste Super sexy but romantic at the same time The neighbourhood is not as bad as they say It s the world famous red light district of Paris but I had no problem and I never felt unsafe even though I walked around at night for a long time And it s really close to Montmartre But most importantly it s a very romantic and sexy place to go as a couple But it s not sleezy at all Staff and the style of the hotel is cool clean and mature There s just a lot of red and it easily gets you in the mood ,1
 I asked for my details to updated at the start of the stay as they had the wrong address phone number and loyalty card number At time of checkout they weren t updated so the receptionist said they will do it and email me a confirmation I wrote to them 48 hours after checking out and still no response from them  Great Location Staff breakfast,1
 Basement room with window facing the pavement room very small not as impressive as it looks on the web site Great location in general clean environment,0
 When in bad you could hear people passing through the corridor as if they were passing through your bed The concept with no door at the bath washing compartment brought the sewage smell widely in the room Owners should try to rest in one room and then make their own opinion upon the part of the hotel  Location,0
 Bedroom was very crampedNo Positive,0

 Dark room too warm With an early train to Europe I was offered a packed breakfast this was not ready and took far too long making me late The staff were most unhelpful The breakfast consisted of an apple an orange a dry roll and a childs fruit drink If that is your standard i hope i never find myself in a Hilton Hotel ever again again Certainly the worst and most expensive hotel in a 20 day rail journey from London to China Nothing,0
 The pool and spa was not in use We paid for a double room and got 2 singles pushed togetherNo Positive,0
 Room 215 is right next to the lift The comings and goings of ither guest kept me awake for ages The fittings in the room are run down Broken shower falls to the bottom of the pole totally unacceptable Damp bathroom roof Hole in the wall behind bathroom mirror Broken fixtures around the bed Really run down I paid over 200 for this I won t be back As for a calculated score of 4 2 your kidding I would not score this particular room better than 2  Location was great,0

 Room service not good waited in que for breakfast for 15mins Then to find food cold The bed was extremely comfy The location was great ,0
 Pathetic service Waited for hours to get a glass of drinking water in the reception area Very inflexible around check in times Limited repetitive and boring breakfast spread The location is great being close to Paddington and Edgeware Road,0
 Our room was a crash pad as we were only there overnight However it was very hot in spite of having the air conditioning turned down low It was also quite noisy  The location was ideal for what we were there for The hotel was very new so obviously clean and fresh ,0
 The layout of the room was a bit awkward Otherwise our stay was lovely and we were very pleased with the accommodation  We loved how close the hotel was to the Metro station yet still tucked away in a quiet area When we wanted to go out for a meal or to sightsee we only had to walk down the street ,1
 No gym or pool Hotel should provide guests with free gym access at nearby gyms  Great location and hotel ,1

"we needed an inexpensive room for the night, and this fit the bill. 
The room was clean, and the only negatives of the stay involved the fitness room, which every piece of exercise equipment was broken or unplugged, and the breakfast was very poorly populated, and barely worth stopping at.",0
 A room with a bath would ve been nice but we didn t put in a specific request so that was something on us  The staff were very friendly the room clean and the bar restaurant was lovely The underground parking was secure convenient and reasonably priced ,1

"The motel is in a convenient location. It is at least as good as the other motels in the immediate area.

The continental breakfast is the worst I have ever experienced.",0

My husband and I stayed on - seperate occasions while driving down to Key West and then coming back. Our first stay was fine. Our second stay was terrible. The room smelled very bad. When I got into the bed the sheets were very wrinkled and I found hairs in the bed. There were alive bugs and dead bugs in the room. I would have asked for another room but we already had taken our showers and ready for bed. This was the worst hotel we ever stayed at.,0

 The staff was not very polite other then the womens and washing ladies were very kind and polite The restaurant is very small and also the bar Had to go out of the hotel and move to another hotel to use the spa and gym which should have been a bit more information about We were looking forward for the spa but had no information about prices etc And its quite misguidence when you order a hotel which they give pictures and information about a spa but the hotel dosent even have a spa And food was not good  The hotel rooms are nice and clean quite comfortabel ,0

 Rooms are on the small side but perfectly adequate for a city break where you don t spend much time in the room  The location was the best aspect of staying at the hotel as it was right in the centre and so convenient for bars and restaurants We walked everywhere ,1
 Wish it was closer it was about 15 min bus ride to downtown Otherwise it wasn t a bad hotel  I liked the rooms and the parking right next door It was spacious enough for us Public transportation is right down the road ,0
 Dreadful rooms shower is completely open toilet door is pathetic these are not rooms for those who value a little privacy Also hotel design must have been created by a frustrated astronaut lighting is terrible staff surly Great location and large bed,0

No Negative Friendly staff Great room and breakfast ,1
 Although the bed was comfortable it felt that I was sinking a bit on the mattress The room was a bit hot even though it was cold outside but the air conditioning helped with this  The location is great and very central for visiting London The room was clean comfortable and big enough for 2 people It was also nice to have treats such as a Nespresso machine and lovely biscuits ,1
 Room 405 cigarette butts left on the window seal althou room was non smoking told the staff and the problem solved Room 610 early morning of the first night stay next room had a domestic problem and we understand the police was involved A little noisy in the area but can understand as in the centre The elevator was not working so we had to use the staff elevator  Breakfast was very good variety of foods available Desk Staff very helpful ,1
 Thin walls The room was very clean and cozy Great staff great breakfast and great value for money We will be back ,1
 Staff have been over trained tried too hard to make a conversation when time could have been better spent explaining the room features etc Buffet breakfast for 25 is not good value at all Nice room bed and shower,0
 The bathrooms could do with an update in particular the shower needed regrouting as all the grout had gone black The location of the hotel,1
 Prices at the pool bar and the pool was too cold Best breakfast great staff throughout ,1

 The bathroom had a huge patch of mold on the wall  Great location,0
No Negative That is a very good hotel ,1
No Negative Location is great and staff was friendly,1

No Negative The hotel is in a quite place in Milano,1
 Stayed in a Superior room which I would have expected it to be somewhat bigger If it s superior I dread to think what the standard rooms are like Make sure you know what you re booking Oh and the Bar doesn t open until LATE afternoon  Excellent Location Within walking staggering crawling distance from everything you need in Amsterdam Central Super helpful and friendly staff Except the grumpy old night man ,1
No Negative The bedroom spacing was really good and cosy The staff were really friendly and they gave me a cookie as I entered the hotel ,1
 Basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge  This hotel trades on its location near the British Muaeum and it s beautiful Victorian facade Once inside the bedrooms it is cramped and basic There are much better hotels in the area for the same price ,0
No Negative Excellent room excellent breakfast very nice and helpful staff ,1
No Negative Lovely hotel in the heart of the le ramblas very good service good rooms comfortable bed and some customized touches Highly recommend this family owned hotel truly a five star hotel,1
 No kettle to make tea or coffee which is usually as basic amenities in hotel staffs hardly speak English one of them didn t know the difference between knife spoon and fork when I paid city tax when check out the receptionist didn t have 2 euros to give me change so they took that extra 2 euros To borrow plates and eating tools guest must take them from receptionist no one will send it to your room  Located in walking distance to Bignami metro station situated in quiet area modern design style,0

 The noise around the was a bit uncontrolled that I could not sleep well No Positive,0
"Book this hotel bascially just on location of hotel to where I needed to go as well as costs. And in those - categories it more than meet my expectations. Neighborhood wasn't bad at all and close to downtown area, nightlife bars-clubs and places to go shopping a plenty.",0
 A bit noisy old fashion At almost 20 the breakfast is definitely not a good deal  Convenient if one arrives departs from the Montparnasse station,0
 Odd smell in hotel corridors Bed was squishy and the springs squeaked  Breakfast was excellent ,0

 We got back to the hotel at 11 and the bar was already shut so had to go out again Would be nice to have a nightcap before going to bed  Location was great Room was very nice Only complaint was the bath plug didn t hold the water Very comfortable with friendly staff ,1
 spa is very poor view from the studio dartist is horrible practicly into wall room service menu could be better Location was great view on eiffel tower from the bar too studio dartis is big and well equiped too,1

 Room a bit tired holes in curtains and blackout blind also curtains don t close properly not nice when a light just outside the window Two people staying in the room but only one robe and slippers provided would have been better to have had none Espresso pods were not replaced after use even though it was requested  Good location nice staff and good breakfast Very amenable to late checkout ,0
 Room standard Deluxe King was advertised but there were only guest rooms We ended up in a twin single bed room after paying for deluxe King room To watch movies we were directed to call reception for a code We called throughout the night and the only person who picked the phone dropped the phone on us The mini bar wouldn t open The bin wouldn t open What was supposed to be a dirty weekend ended up as a nightmare Cleanliness,0

 No valet parking Luxury suite with roof top Terence oversee view of Paddington area 3 stories design with comfortable bed and nice sitting area for relaxing ,1
"Stayed one night, Sept -, ----. Hotel is very run down and dirty. Rooms are tiny and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever encountered. Other than location there is absolutely no reason to stay here. It was awfull.",0
 Basement room avoid at all costs Like a sweat box Choose between noisy air conditioning or silence and heat Shower was useless Scalding hot shower head kept flicking up into my face then a tiny towel Breakfast poor soulless little room scrambled eggs watery bacon part undercooked and part overlooked This is a guest house dressed up It is not as someone said elsewhere the best hotel in London For those who don t know a good hotel when they see one ask yourself why this is available when everything else is full  Not a lot Spacious room and good location ,0
 The room was not well laid out There was no windows in the Queen bedroom just a frosted door which when opened led to the fire exit Probably not the easiest place to stay if traveling into back and forth from the hotel to central londonNo Positive,0
 Smallest double room ever seen The hotel lobby,0
 It s definitely not a proper 5 star hotel Not organised with regards to room cleaning 3 cleaners walked into the room within a span of one hour without knocking Furthermore no one helped with the baggage during check out They have a day tax of approx 7 euro which must be payed in cash Personally I think it s to evade taxes when hotels request for cash to be paid The front desk staff were friendly The shower drainage was not sufficient and would fill up during a shower I suppose coming from the middle east the hotel standards are very high and as a result most European hotels can t compare You need to lower your expectations  Location and the toilet is quite fancy and high tech which is cool,0
 Check in Cleaness,0
 Location from center Spacy rooms ,1
 I don t like they re not helpful that much The noise i couldn t sleep because all sounds get into the room and when you asked for something they took a long time to get it to you The design of the hotel is marvelous,0

No Negative Clean room great location staff was excellent,1
 One thing location hmm difficult get to the center by tram ok fine it takes 30 min but in every way it cost 3 euro and It looks dangerous go by tram in the evening so if you want to keep safe is necessary coming earlier and you miss a lot of attractions in center But anyway hotel is very good  Breakfast tasty completly enough for first meal People around very helpful Ice dispenser in lounge Great idea It s nothing to say more about advantages because it s too much Very good hotel ,1
No Negative Great breakfast with fresh natural orange juice and live jazz musicians Perfect hotel ,1
 Breakfast and staff confusion  Breakfast poor quality Can learn from Radisson blu View not great but considering location can t be helped Confusion as to what i booked and paid for Annoying running around from 16 to first floor Just as well had proof confirming breakfast included ,0
 Nothing Excellent breakfast especially home made granola Wonderful aroma in reception,1
 Thin walls you can hear everything in the rooms on both sides The tube station nearby isn t a key line so I ended up taking cabs  Freshly renovated Cookie at check in was a surprise ,1
 Lady on the reception was rude and she s not professional No Positive,0
 Can t think of anything as it was perfect  Service superior,1
 The rooms were very small with 2 single bed put together for a double bed so as soon as you sat on the bed it would just slide forward and the floor boards didn t help breakfast choice was very limited with no crossiants biscuits or anything as such no fresh orange juice some oranges with a small squeezer for you to squeeze your own juice which no one would even bother trying not happy The location close to everything,0
 I want a room with outside view Staff,1
"check in was crazy, when you first get there, there is a lot of confusion of what you are suppose to do, lines were not to bad when we arrived but were told that was unusual. we stayed in the west tower facing the river and the lake which was awesome, the small boys loved looking out the window at the water and all the lights at night. room was nice minus finding a dirty pair of underwear in the drawer, but the hotel did pay for our breakfast in exchange for that. downside of the hotel also was no pool. breakfast was wonderful, lots of selections and tasted great. check out was okay minus you dont get a reciept unless you go to the front desk.",0
 very small rooms tiny bed supposedly for two but not even enough for 1 person ok location,0
 Basic rooms but that is reflected in price to be honest Staff friendly and super breakfast,0

 Nothing Fantastic hotel Staff amazing Fantastic central location,1
No Negative The Location is great The breakfast was wonderful and the staff more than helpful We asked for a parking place and we could leave the car there during two days even if we stayed one night We checked in at 11 am instead of 3 pm with no problem the room was ready Nice furnished and decorated room with a nespresso Bright and clean The lobby was renovated ,1
 The walking but your away  It was so relaxing The night man was very nice ,1
 I though the bar food could be much better The menu was limited  The atmosphere was nice The bathroom was clean and modern,1
 The breakfast bar needs to be made bigger it is very narrow and you cannot get to the things you want especially when people are making and waiting for the waffle machine You keep bumping into people  The staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 The rooms are small but clean and cosy The cleaning staff is very noisy No parking available pricy if needed a garage The parking service is even more expensive 37 euros day and every time you need the car it will charge an extra 12 euros way basicaly more than renting a car  Great location just 2 min walk to Stephan s Dome restaurants and main attractions Available rooms for smokers ,1
 The rooms were so hot and we were trying to get ready and showered twice because the fan system wasn t working The beds were uncomfortableNo Positive,0
 Extremely small bedroom Hall Carpets need to be cleaned Average Breakfast Bad WIFI system Location was good Bedrooms clean and tidy,1
 We have been in this hotel two years ago we came again because we didnt know it will be so dissapointing Air conditioner Heat in the room was bad the sheets were badly filthy there was a problem with the window even that it was closed cold air went inside the room the most dissapointing thing was the breakfast as we remembered a big veraity if food we barely ate something No vegetables at all and more sugary things than food Defenitely not worth the cost even if its quite low No Positive,0
 Does not apply as it was very good did not find anything wrong here  The location was perfect close enough to Amsterdam centre without the noise and the crowds there is a free ferry which takes you back and forward all day long the journey took only 12 mins and it is right outside the train station The hotel was fantastic we got a great deal through booking com The staff were really nice friendly etc couldn t ask for better Will stay here again and have already recommended it to family and friends There is a large eaterie called Pllek which we visited on the last day it is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel which was well worth a visit the burger here was delicious so was the wild boar sausage ,1
 The staff very rude and racistNo Positive,0
 Extremely small room Room 314 Not large enough to open suitcases Badly designed bathroom toilet in terms of access and size  Excellent location ,0
 We got an Eiffel tower view which did not look like the picture could only see the tower if we stood on the balcony and looked right When I expressed my disappointment they said this was the best they could do  Great location nice modern hotel comfortable beds nice bathroom,1
 We had pre booked a room only to get there find it had been given to someone else Then told they didn t have a similar room available which we refused to accept Got given a room as we opened the door walked in on someone already staying in that room Fuming at this stage we were given a twin room which was nothing like the room described or paid for Not a good experience Staff very unhelpful No Positive,0
No Negative When we checked in the staff noticed it was my birthday and they put a card and a slate saying happy birthday in our room which I though was so thoughtful The room was very clean and comfortable and in a great location as it is only 5 mins from the centre of Amsterdam by train or tram ,1
 Standard rooms are VERY small there is no space to hang a long coat and even a medium size suitcase will just fit between the end of the bed and the wall  Excellent location just off Hyde Park with two tube stations within one minute walk Complimentary fruit in the lobby is healthy and a nice touch ,1
"This is a very large resort that is sprawled out with different suites. We stayed in the Cambelback suites which is closer to the main lobby and water park. There is a resort fee that is tacked on and we were lucky enough that the water park was opened for the New Years weekend so at least felt we got something out of the resort fee. This resort offers golf, bike rentals, a jogging trail, golf and a spa. There are also a handful of pools to choose from if the water park is closed. The rooms and grounds were kept very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. I agree they could update the tv's but that is not really a complaint for me. The beds are extremely comfortable but do not consider the sofa bed a bed! Very uncomfortable.",1
No Negative Excellent location fabulous size room very clean bathroom fluffy towels,1
 Tiny room with small bed Very good price,0
 Staff attempt to get into our room twice When I asked why you are getting in without knocking Answer was I saw the light and I wanted to check it  Congress suit was very nice to stay with seperated rooms lerge living space Location of the hotel is also perfect We didnt used any public transfer during our turistic visit i coz there was no need ,1
 Nothing needs improvement  Staff were absolutely wonderful It was our anniversary celebration and they made us feel so special We can t thank them enough for the upgrade and the extras A wonderful hotel ,1
 Didn t like the double bed being two single beds put together  Nice spacious room very clean and really great location ,1
 On gaining access to the room it became apparent that the bathroom had not be cleaned the toilet had not even been flushed and had to get house keep back to finish the job not what you expect from a 4 star hotel A very disappointing start to my stay Also very unhelpful with an error on booking the system have inadvertently booked 2 breakfasts for one person and they refused to take this off the bill and still charged for 2 not 1  Location fine for the trip I was making ,0
 The bed The shower Not up to hotel standard I am afraid The mattress was lumpy and was starting to collapse Lets put it this way it wouldn t pass as a guest bed in any ones house The shower was fine if you were under 5 ft I am 6ft4 and my head was against the ceiling pressed against a down lighter with water spraying every where Not great is an understatement  location and staff very good,1
 Not a true 4 star hotel  Location walking distance to major attractions ,0
No Negative Generally good bed could have been a little softer and would appreciate one more pillow ,0
 Booking com said this hotel was near Finchley Central which is not true and meant that we had to get a taxi to and from the tube stop The nearest tube to this hotel is about a 20 30 min walk Our door key didn t work when we arrived nor did 2 replacements The staff suggested that we just ask someone from reception to come up with us and let us in every time we wanted to get in I asked for a different room however and we were eventually relocated to a different floor However in the second room a lamp the shower door and the extractor fan was broken  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable ,0
 It was a little out of the way from the tourist attractions but there were some really lovely places to eat near it  Friendly staff beautiful hotel with great facilities ,1
 It is a it far from the centre and also from the metro  It is a nice hotel which is not expensive,1
 Breakfast was average Front desk was not very helpful on checkout When we asked to leave our bags they said their cloakroom was full They made no effort to help I had to insist before they made any effort  Location was fairly good Rooms were clean comfortable and spacious ,0
 When you propose attractive rates would be appreciative if you would also mention that you are not going to sell rooms but couches where a toilet room is in size 60 x 60 cm and the room size is 200 x 240 cm NOT LEGAL I m sorry to say No Positive,0
No Negative Fantastic hotel staff very friendly and accommodating ,1
 The apartment was an odd set up with a poorly equipped kitchen for example no fridge or bottle opener The keys to our room rarely worker and had to be reprogrammed almost each time we needed to open the door  Great location Apartments was large ,0
 Pool area was a bit hit miss  Room size quite small but adequate with good decor well presented Tapas in afternoon was a nice touch I received a bottle of Cava on my Birthday curtocy of hotel ,1
"Modern business hotel located one block from bustling Times Sqare. Swift check in and immaculate rooms, seek to be upgraded to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Executive Club"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" floors, the furnishings are a little better and you get free breakfast etc. Very pricey ($---), but sets a high standard for a business hotel.",0
 Waitress staff in restaurant were rude Conveniently close to RAI Exhibition centre Great food in the restaurant ,0
 Rooms far too small booked a superior room but nothing superior about it Bed was hard pillows were hard no sheets only a duvet that had seen better days Shower leaked all over the bathroom due to inadequate screen  Staff friendly Breakfast was nice but felt should have been included for the room price Also weren t told by reception if you pre booked the day before it was 10 instead of 15 ,0

 Small public areas like breakfast lobby reception Tiny bathroom without shelves Breakfast too crowded small restaurant Central location housekeeping is excellent reception team very professional ,1
 Broken mirror in room No where to sit at breakfast poor breakfast Expected more when paying over 200 per night  Location was excellent,0
 I thing that the carpets are due for change or strong foam clean  I am a fan of this hotel This is my 5th or 6th time in 7 years Can t advise on restaurant or room service or even the facilities I simply come for 3 main reasons 1 wonderful view for the marina looking rooms enchanting at night and freshening in the morning 2 quietness tranquilty of the location and surroundings 3 decent 4 stars hotel comfortable beds very good bathroom coffee tea kettle even espresso machine fridge good ac Staff so nice ,1
"Stylish apartment in the centre of town, we loved our stay at Thi's place, it's right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of HCMC and easy walking distance to all the major sites as well as a lot of cool bars and restaurants. Thi was really quick to get back to me and a thoughtful host. Check out the Secret Garden restaurant and Propaganda restaurant, both really close by.

 More impressed that one is the alarm given in the 2 35 am over 5 mins the noise woke us up including under 2 years child and announced us needed to leave the building my child cried and scared however the next day no staff explained or apologized Another thing is not replenished facial tissues not toilet roll and cleaned wine glasses in the next three nights Actually it is not a good experience to stay in the Best Western Premier hotel  Delicious breakfast and great decoration of hotel ,0
 There was a lot of noise and the elevator was very shocking Location was very good,0
 I did  The room was pokey There was no extractor in the bathroom and if the door was left open after a shower the steam set off the smoke alarm The air conditioning was obviously controlled by management the room was stuffy and far too hot The pillos were uncomfortable The accomodation was claustropobic,0
 Breakfast was bad Air con was bad Not good value for what we paid No security card in elevator so anyone can access floors We paid e xtra for a balcony and breakfast and both were disappointing Not an actual balcony For the price I would stay elsewhere  Location good Nice rooftop patio,0

 We ordered an extra bed which was promised us later this day In the evening no additional bed in the room was ready Even after 2 times re asking and 3 hours waiting nothing The hotel manager then gave us some sheets and a pillow and our guest had to sleep on the floor On the day before the room service would deliver a pizza late at night about 02 00 which we never ordered he said oh sorry this is a mistake The hotel has not even lowerde the price Poor service through and through from a Hilton hotel I would clearly expect more  Nice and extensive breakfast buffet Very quiet and comfortable rooms ,0

 The breakfast hall got rather crowded at times and does not seem big enough for the amount of people that stay here There is however the executive lounge for overflow but the service here is not as good  Great views Friendly and helpful staff really good location great breakfast and also lovely restaurants on site Would definitely recommend to friends and family ,1

 problems with airco te noisy to cold and after complaining tree times still not solved breakfast was disappointing for an expensive hotel eggs were an extra but without mentioning this in advance surprise on invoice at check out they promised to wright apology letter but never received location,0
 This time May 2017 we paid double the price for the same room we paid 277 for 2 nights Oct 2016 and though we have booked yet again for October 2017 the same dates as last year again it is nearly twice the price We will check prices elsewhere throughout this year unless we are offered a good deal  This was our second visit to this hotel the layout and the comfort of the room is good ,0
 There is no enough information about the hotel and its services The sink is downstairs and the bath upstairs the room are plenty of stuff that don t work properly like a cafeteria and microwave The carpet is the worst and dirty I ve ever met If you are allergic to dust keep out this place The stairs are too tight and dangerous even for younger I won t visit this place anymore  Nothing ,0
 Cleaning of room was often left until mid or late afternoon making a short nap impossible  Bed very comfortable My room had a great view over the Singel canal Staff in breakfast room very friendly and helpful especially Sri ,1
 The bed was too springy you could actually feel the springs Also the room smelled like smoke The elevator needs to be serviced  The location is right in the heart of things Easy walk to get to main tourist areas The staff was friendly helpful ,0
"Do not stay here if you have an oversized vehicle or you are pulling a trailer. After getting over his initial surprise that I actually had reservations to stay here, the bellman was happy to let me know that there was nothing he or any of the hotel staff would be able to do to help me find a place to park my truck and mobile lab trailer. I was given a standard list of unmanned general parking lots in the area that were only suitable for Smart cars. After making the -- hour drive here, I gave up quickly on finding a place to park and found another hotel. Thank you, Hilton for saving the day.",0
"The apartment was perfect, true to pic and has everything thats required. Love the overall layout, spacious balcony and picturesque roof garden. <br/><br/>Kudos to the friendly staffs that constantly small talks/ gave nearby recommendation when required.<br/><br/>The entrance may not be as obvious as it is right behind a mobile phone shop, require the remote to open/close the shuttle at night - good security though. Stone throw to a mart end of street (closes at 10pm) and a Circle K - 24hrs. Highly recommended!",1

"upon checkin, front desk couldnt find my reservation by my name until I presented my confirmation number (and only then it took a second front desk staffer to do so). When a fire alarm went off throughout hotel, guests who went to front desk were told they should evacuate """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""if alarm going off on their floor"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (it was going off on all floors). I left a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""please make up room sign on my door when left early in am, and upon arriving late at night found a note under door saying, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we respected your wishes not to disturb you,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and did not make up room. room and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sleep quality"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ratings low because of very thin walls, through which one could easily hear neighboring room.",0

 Toilet bowl was not flushed when I checked into room which spoilt the whole experience No Positive,0
 Lift is too smal  Location chees degustation breakfast And staff readiness to assist ,1
 How I was recieved Had booked double room but was first put into a single When I questioned this I was made to feel like it was my own fault  Location good Walking distance to centre ,0
 At check in there was an issue as we received a room without any view although it was advertised as so However after a complain the room was changed and it was just perfect  Big room great restaurant excellent panoramic view ,1
 Very disappointed for value for money photos were absolutely nothing like the rooms room very dated with cheep facelift Even the hall ways felt like a hostel with pink hand rails Double bed wasn t available on arrival so had to sleep in separate bed form partner If i was told it was a 2 star I would have said it was perfect but it was the worst 4 star hotel iv ever seen  Staff were helpful was clean 2 min walk from tram stop in very peaceful part of city and right next to park ,0
 The bed was really bad the air conditioning did not work and you cannot open a window the breakfast feels rushed for lack of better word and a health hotel without stairs to change floors is awkward  Solid hotel with all the basic needs and reasonably priced and well connected with public transport The wifi worked well too ,0
 The smell of the towels were strange like somebody wash them with olive oil  I like the design of this hotel its unique in addition the location is perfect between Dumo and the street of brands ,1

 If you have a room with boulevard view it could be a little bit noisy because of the traffic  Great location just near the metro station Great service very pleasant reception Great breakfast Very clean Wifi all around the hotel even in rooms,1
 I stayed for three nights and the bar was closed for renovations on two of those nights No mention of this little nugget when I booked by the way Luckily there was a decent pub over the road Also no free WiFi in the rooms is a no no Just because the building is a couple if centuries old doesn t mean the facilities have to be  The building was full of character and the room was well appointed Superb location close to the tube and museums ,0
 Our first impression during check in was that the reception staff was not very friendly It could be that they are not fluent in English Although the hotel is within walking distance there is a building nearby where quite a number of homeless sleep overnight this may pose as a security risk we didn t run into any issues though The breakfast was so so with a very small selection some cold meats cheeses and biscuits No warm hot food  The location of the hotel is okay as it is walking distance from the train and metro station The hotel room does not have a kettle but the staff at the bar will gladly heat up some water and put it in a teapot complete with a set of tea cups when requested ,0
 The rooms are very small which would be ok if there was a place to put the suit case under the bed for example Coffee from fresh beans was only available on certain mornings the other days it was instant coffee that was served with breakfast  Good location English breakfast which was very nice Complimentary coffee tea and cookies in the room Friendly staff Wireless Lan was excellent there are routers on every floor and it was very stable ,0
 I paid 400 for 2 nights room only and they forgot to clean the room I was disgusted The hotel was nice but not that special Definitely not value for money The reception staff were very friendly and the shower was lovely ,0

 The hotel is a glorified Premier Inn but charges far more The room was dark and cramped not enough coat hangers the bathroom did not have a proper door The hotel includes the word Rembrandt Square in its name giving the illusion it is actually in the square it isn t The website includes pictures of Amsterdam giving the illusion that the rooms have a view they don t No Positive,0
"Excellent hotel, very large rooms. Quiet comfortable neighborhood close to subway. Eight block walk from Grand Central. If you like Asian food East is two blocks away and has fabulous food and service, reasonably priced. There are also some amazing delis close by,ask the hotel staff which ones are the best bet. Stay away from the restaurant at the hotel, and the Mexican around the corner is mediocre at best",1
 We were told that the bar and restaurant were being refurbished As we weren t eating or drinking there that wasn t a problem for us However They lied it was also the function room lobby and garden as well being refurbished We basically walked into a building site I even had to wipe dust off the counter Annoyed that I had to pay 120 to spend a night with a baby in a building site my temper wasn t tempered when we arrived for breakfast in the function room or should I say the highway for builders The hotel didn t even have a high chair for the baby Thoroughly disappointed and a waste of money  Room and staff were great ,0

"My wife n I were on the westside of LA n need a place to stay so we decided to give Hotel Erwin a call n see if they could accomodate us. They did n I have to say that our experience, for the -nd time, did not disappoint. We got a great room with an amazing of of the ocean, santa monica pier, as well as santa monica. The service was excellent, my wife had accidently burned her hand earlier in the day n it began hurting her in the middle of the night n all I had to do was call the front desk n they sent up some burn-first aid spray to alleviate the pain. Would definitely recommend this hotel to all who are looking for a fun.cool,hip, centrally located hotel on the westside.",1
"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Rex, tacking on a few days to a business trip I had to the bay area. Basically, from reading the hotel website and reviews here, I can just confirm that Hotel Rex is as advertised - very friendly and helpful staff (not stuffy or pushy in any way); rooms are not huge, but comfortable, clean and stylish. The location is great - near trolley and bus lines, walking distance to Union Square shopping, restaurants and bars. Of course the lobby-
bar is a great place to hang out and enjoy the nightly wine reception. Overall, just a cool, reasonably priced hotel in the heart
of San Francisco. If-when we return I would stay at the Rex again or maybe try another of the Joie de Vivre hotels.",1

"Went for a conference (BroadSoft Connections) and place has great conference facilities, food was especially good considering that they were catering for over ---- people. 
Room (----) was standard for this type of resort if a little smaller than some.
Lazy River is a great place to relax but stay away from the CLEAR rings (not flattering!). 
Resort charge includes WiFi which is available everywhere and surprisingly fast and reliable. Great to avoid ludicrous roaming charges.",1
